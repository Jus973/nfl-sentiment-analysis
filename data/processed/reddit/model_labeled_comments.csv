i1tkcqd,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,stormy2587,I sort of agree. I think to some extent giving up a lot of picks can be more harmful to a team long term than giving up like a single pick in the top 100. The draft is to some extent just dumb luck and finding contributors in the later rounds has been huge for some franchises. And not having those picks reduces the odds of doing that. Like Tyreek Hill was a 5th round pick. The chiefs finding an elite speed receiver in the 5th in 2016 was a huge part of them unlocking the high scoring offense starting in 2017. I don’t think this is a bad trade for miami per se just that I think number of picks in a draft matters to some extent. The Dolphins aren’t the most complete roster in the nfl and they just spent 6 picks on a single player. I think most teams would hope to net 3 contributors from those picks.

You can break a degree up until smaller units: minutes. And there are--predictably enough!-60 minutes of arc in one degree of arc. That means that there 21,600 minutes around the whole sphere. And a nautical mile is defined as the distance on Earth that corresponds to 1 degree of arc in the Earth's surface.

i1tmq1z,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,InHoc12,Which multiple HOF defensive players are you talking about? Lol. Richard Seymour was solid but he was a 30 year old and then signed pretty reasonable extensions and continued to play well (pro bowler in 2010 and 2011 and second team all pro in 2011) for the Raiders so it was a fair trade. He's literally the closest thing to a HOF defensive player you've traded. Wilfork was a stud but you just let him go in free agency at the end of his time. Kyle Van Noy you traded for so he wasn't homegrown and he just walked at the end. Willie McGinest was released. Lawyer Milloy was released. Ty Law was released. Ty Warren was released. Teddy Bruschi retired as a Patriot. Rodney Harrison retired as a Patriot. Asante Samuel walked in free agency. Malcolm Butler walked in free agency. Trey Flowers walked in free agency. Hightower is likely leaving in free agency. McCourty has been a long term patriot. Patrick Chung left for a year and came back in free agency. Literally the only guy I can remotely think of that you traded that was on defense that was remotely close to a HOF is Mike Vrabel. Chandler Jones was for a second round pick and Gilmore a sixth round pick. Those are literally the only two other guys you traded... and got no where near the haul of Hill and neither are remotely as good as Hill. Like no you didn't trade anyone on defense even remotely close to Hill's ability (let alone multiple) but keep being a homer lol.,22,2022-03-23 10:45:10,tkztsx,3.0,2,0,0,2.0,0.0711115524172782,0.6445252299308777,0.2843632698059082,0.2132517041341698,

i1uf9in,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,,"The way I look at the NBA is the most important statistic is one thing: salary. You can’t sign a bunch of super stars and expect to be good because you’ll run out of money quickly. Role players also get a ton of money so managing cap is very difficult and very important. That being said, if you obtain a certain amount of success with a team and you’ve been on that team for a significant amount of time, you get something called “bird rights” which then allows you to sign players for more money, going OVER the salary cap. This allows teams to maintain their salary under the condition that the player has already played for that team. It’s also how players gain massive contracts, such as the one Gianni’s antetokounmpo signed the previous year for a quarter of a billion dollars. Going over the salary cap has its price. If you go over it for one year, every dollar that goes over doubles. So let’s say you’re a dollar over, that dollar must be paid twice. This is called the “luxury tax” and the multipliers go up every year until it hits 4. So if a team is overpaying the salary cap by 10 million, and that’s been occurring for 4 years, the team must pay a 40 million dollar luxury tax. This is already on top of existing salaries. You must be thinking that’s impossible, no team can pay that and be profitable. That would be correct, only major market teams break even such as the lakers. That’s why having a good owner, and one that is willing to pay huge dollars to keep a team together, is so important. So tldr is that salary cap is very important and very complicated.

He still could have been involved, despite the findings. You are clearly misinformed about the case because you're going along with the public narrative that this is some mystery where we don't know what happened. We do know what happened. Lewis was with a group of people that were attacked by another group of people outside a nightclub. Two people ended up being killed as a result of being stabbed by two of the people Lewis was with. All witnesses involved testified that Lewis was trying to break the fight up. Lewis testified and identified the two people who committed the stabbings. The courts determined (fairly quickly and easily) that this was a clear-cut case of self-defence and the two people who committed the killings were acquitted. Nobody, not the police, the lawyers involved or any of the witnesses actually thought for a second that Ray actually did any killing. He initially lied about being at the club that night and then ended up testifying, so he was charged with obstruction of justice. The lawyers and police involved with the case fully admitted that the only reason they charged Lewis with murder was to get him to testify about who actually did the killings, which is what eventually happened. >Most importantly, a verdict does not always sway the court of public opinion. This is sometimes good, and sometimes bad. Plenty of obviously bad people are found not guilty or booked on lesser charges. Our legal system has an undeniable bias toward supporting the wealthy.

Wayne at 36 was comparable to his production at 24 and 25. Harrison was an all pro at 34 and got significantly hurt at 35. Boldin had 800 yards and 4 TDs in 14 games at 35. Keyshawn was about the same or less productive at 33 and 34 than most guys I mentioned that you just complained about lol. Moss was a homer pick because he was trash after 32.

Which every single one of those guys still had a season at or near the top of the league between ages 33 and 36 even if they had a bad year or 2 before retiring (often due to a significant injury which is more significant due to them already being at the tail end of their careers). Hill may completely destroy his leg tomorrow and be fucked, but so could Chase or Jefferson. To this point, Hill has been most healthy like a lot of the guys I listed. There's no reason to think he can't play well until 33 or 34. People exaggerate the drop off at 30 for players all the time. It's not even 30 anymore either.

That guy said Watson could put up mahomes numbers and right now he can’t. Watson is incredibly gifted where his ceiling is comparable to mahomes but Watson is inconsistent. Look at his games this year to see, one game it’s 400 yards the next it’s 202 and 0TD. One minute he throws a beautiful ball off his back foot 20 yards down field, the play after that he’ll miss a layup of slant pass.

Deshaun Watson on the other hand still played ridiculously good and wasn’t able to win on most of those statistically impressive games, so clearly he isn’t the issue with the team. What’s your point? If the Texans would’ve had a better team but Deshaun Watson underperformed, then clearly he’s one of the issues with the team but that’s not the case.

He adds stability and a solid passer who is very consistent and that is an amazing thing. What I meant is he doesn’t add anything special. He doesn’t add the insane game iq of Brady, or the rocket arm of Allen or Mahomes. He doesn’t have the crazy legs of Lamar or the shiftiness of Wilson and Watson. He doesn’t have that “it” factor that an elite qb needs. When scheming against the titans a team doesn’t need to change their playstyle to adapt to him. He runs the offense exactly as vrable wants, and doesn’t make mistakes. That’s why the team started 2-4 cause mariota made a lot of mistakes. So when I say he doesn’t add anything I mean more that he doesn’t hurt the offense but he isn’t the type of guy you can build your offense around cause there’s nothing insanely special about him. Like imo his best trait is his consistency, which yes is exactly what is needed in that offense. But when I think of a qbs skill, what I’m imagining is if every qb was put on a team that is completely average but made exactly for them, who would be the best. I can’t see tanehill leading an average team to be top 5 more than I can see Brady(who has many times) Lamar(who has a below average offense and makes it elite) Allen (who is in a similar boat to lamar although he does have an amazing wr, still adds more to the offense) Mahomes, Rodgers, Wilson, and watson (who will be excellent next year. On the prison team where he belongs). I do believe he could lead that team to be top 10, but I value actual skill over production and I don’t think tanehill is a top 5 most skilled qb. I think he is 9th, 8th excluding Watson. And I’m not just talking about raw talent, I’m including mental talent and how refined and all that. Cause tbh production comes just as much from the system and players around the qb as it does from him, skill is really what separates the best from the rest",1,2021-05-22 20:44:05,nio78u,,6,3,0,9.5,0.1832057982683181,0.5091503858566284,0.3076437711715698,0.1244379772216829,3.0

And I do understand what you’re saying but Allen was an mvp front runner this year. Stafford has shown what he can do and although he’ll take a step up this year, it’s not as much as Allen can do. Allen has way more potential than Stafford and Tanehill and last year showed that he has refined himself. I agree sole qbs do fall off but usually it’s cause their season is clearly a fluke when looking at it, either like Wentz where he only was good on 3rd and 4th or with the qbs you mentioned who still had glaring flaws. This off-season Allen managed to eliminate almost all of those so unless he somehow redevelops them he is top 7.

I also never thought he was too 5 as someone earlier in the thread said, despite his stats supporting that. I’m just glad we were able to clarify enough to go from “he doesn’t add anything to the team” to he’s “a top 10 QB”, especially considering finding a multi-year starter at QB is difficult enough, let alone finding a top 10 one. My only refute is that just because his play doesn’t jump out at you like the other guys you mentioned, doesn’t mean he doesn’t have an “it” factor. Leadership and winning can be an “it” factor. Brady was not known for his crazy game IQ for quite some time early in his career. He was known for winning at all costs. In no way am I comparing the two, just using him as an example.

He is #1 wherever he goes until he shows he cant do it.

Chalk it up to being in the middle of the whirlwind and getting 3 QB names seared into the crevices of my brain for a month. I can for sure say it was 80-90% coverage about ""The 49ers are taking Mac Jones"" though. And given that the FO came out and said that: * They didn't try as hard for Stafford as the media suggested * They didn't try as hard for Deshaun Watson as the media suggested * They didn't try as hard for Aaron Rodgers as the media suggested * They didn't try as hard for Joe Flacco as the media suggested * They didn't try as hard for Mac Jones as the media suggested I'm way more inclined to believe the Niners FO over basically anyone in sports media right now, at least over Niners matters. The media grasps at straws and the Niners FO doesn't leak. I'm sure of these two things at this point. To pull it back to the thread topic, does this mean they're accurate about the Titans going hard after Julio, or that they're accurate that the Titans are the most likely landing zone?

h0ovt7t,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,Curonjr,"Tacking on to that one point that most Brady haters make is that he played under-market value which was unfair and gave them an advantage as they could build more around him. Now imagine a situation where he can play under market value and get others to buy in that way they could trade their cap space to other teams directly for players who would help them win a Superbowl and would also be willing to play under market value. This way you don't need to give up draft picks or players, just cap space that you didn't need to use anyways. This could be abused pretty easily if players care more about winning than they do money. I think if you had a situation like this then you would need to say teams have to use up 90% of their cap each year before trading any leftover cap space away.

h11pdpf,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,Kalanar,"NFL has two types of spending. Cash spending and cap spending. You can think of cap spending like monopoly money in the NFL game. At it's most basic rule you have to use 1 cap dollar for every $1 dollar you spend on a player however there are ways to delay this. The most common being a signing bonus. In that case you can pay a player $20 million in real money but instead of having to use 20 million in cap space you can use 4 million in cap space a year over 5 years. It still equals that 20 million in cap space it just delays it. If you cut or trade the player before all 5 years are up however all that cap space you still owe the NFL advances up to be due in the current year. This is what the Falcons are seeing with Julio. They owe the NFL 23,250,000 cap space(7,750,000 X 3 years). This isn't actual money being paid to Julio it's already been paid to him, the Falcons simply were delaying paying the cap space for it. Since he was traded the NFL wants all that cap space now. However another rule the NFL has is if the cut/trade takes place after June 1st you don't have to pay it all back this year it can be spread out over two years. Which is why the Falcons were waiting to trade him. In that case the 7,750,000 in cap space they owe the NFL this year stays the same but the final two years(15,500,000) advance to hit their cap next year. It still totals the 23,250,000 in total cap space they owe the NFL.",5,2021-06-08 09:44:57,nv6gbo,,0,0,0,2.0,0.2381378263235092,0.7189881205558777,0.0428739562630653,-0.1952638870205862,3.0

i6mvzpi,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,KingTwist0314,"Honestly, the Eagles had a great first day of the draft. Jordan Davis was the best DT in the draft imo and he will be great for Philly, I think he was worth the trade up because I'm sure the Ravens would've picked him if he was there. I do think they could've stayed where they were and pick up Kyle Hamilton but this was a fine move regardless. Basically trading their second 1st round pick for AJ Brown was a fantastic move considering Brown is likely better right now than any other WR in this draft will be in the future. Giving up a 1st and then having to pay him 25 million is a steep price to pay but I do think it was worth it because imo Brown is a top 10 WR in the league and should immediately come in and make the Eagles better from the jump. The Eagles are inarguably better now and I'm certainly not excited about seeing Brown twice a year lol.",42,2022-04-28 23:18:20,ueb3m7,,2,1,0,6.5,0.0055914465337991,0.0329206697642803,0.961487889289856,0.955896427855605,1.0

i6nt8rd,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,JackFisherBooks,"True, but a better QB is the overriding factor there. That said, Philly has shown in the past that they know how to surround their QBs with capable talent and a good system. Nick Foles might not have been on the same level as most top tier QBs, but he had a very capable cast of receivers and tight ends around him. And he, along with Wentz before he got hurt, was able to carry that team to the playoffs. Philly just hasn't had that cast of talent in a while. But AJ Brown will definitely help. I still believe Jalen Hurts can elevate his game enough to compete with teams like Dallas. But I still think they're a few pieces away. I'm also not confident Dallas can pick up where they left off.

I bring this up because everyone wasnt quick to turn on wentz because of his draft profile. In reality you need to just give young qbs time and surrounded them with actual talent. In 2016 we had garbage defense, good line, and no wrs. Wentz and the team looked competent but still struggled. We literally saw the same thing happen this year.

i6nvwmf,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,moesus81,"That’s fair and Dak is significantly better than Hurts right now (and Wentz obviously, since I mentioned Washington) The SB team was just magical and everything just fell into place that year. The defense held ATL to 10 and MIN to 7. It’s hard to lose games in that situation, even though they were real close to losing the ATL game. Luckily Foles was able to step up in the SB when Brady was just absolutely shredding us for 500 yards. Ertz was our leading pass catcher that year, the top 2 WR (Algholor and Jeffery) didn’t have huge years. They had 119 catches for 1,557 yards and 17 TD combined. AJ Brown is a significant upgrade over both of those guys. Philly’s OL and DL is better than Dallas as well but QB is just too important in this era. Hopefully Hurts can improve with a much better cast around him. I like Schultz a lot but who is going to be the #2 WR while Gallup is out? ACL isn’t a huge deal anymore but it might take him a while to play at the same level as well. I’m also not too confident in Dallas this year but the NFL is so unpredictable, so we’ll see. If Washington’s D is like it was 2 years ago and Wentz doesn’t completely choke when it matters, they will be a problem as well. NFC East is open for the taking aside from NYG.

I wouldn't be surprised if Reagor is more comfortable in the slot like Agholor in 2017, but if he isn't then we still have Paschal to try out there. And if Hurts can't keep up with the NFL with these toys, he will never be the guy. Assuming quality QB play, this is a division winning offense and dark horse for a solid playoff run.

i6nyeu4,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,JackFisherBooks,"I agree. That Super Bowl run by Philly was truly magical. That team just had everything clicking in all the right ways. That's not something you can repeat. Foles just got hot at the right time. And to date, I've never seen Hurts get hot in the same way. But Hurts has never had someone like AJ Brown to throw to. And if the defense steps up, he might not have to win so many games on his own. I think that's key because, unless you're Tom Brady, you just can't win ball games like that. I'm also not at all confident that Washington will make it work with Wentz. In fact, I suspect that team will completely collapse halfway through the season and will be in the running for the number one overall pick. Their defense just fell apart last year. Plus, Wentz just can't stay healthy. I saw this happen last year with Fitzpatrick. Washington was hyping him up all offseason, hoping he could win with a dominant defense. Then, the defense regressed and Fitz got hurt in the first quarter of the first game. That doesn't bode well for Wentz. I honestly don't see him starting all 16 games in this season or any season at this point. The NFC East will be competitive, but I think it'll be between Dallas and Philly. I also think the Giants might take a step forward. I think Daniel Jones is no world-beater, but he hasn't had a lot of weapons to work with, let alone a defense. Maybe this year finally starts to change that. Guess we'll have to wait and see.",3,2022-04-29 06:43:27,ueb3m7,,3,1,0,5.5,0.0412309095263481,0.1777315586805343,0.781037449836731,0.739806593544192,3.0

AJ's best seasons are almost certainly ahead of him (barring injury). I'm a St. Louis native and the AJ Brown trade makes me feel like I did when Pujols signed with the Angels. It's fucking gut-wrenching. But it's actually worse than that trade was. It's more like if Pujols had signed with the Angels in 2005 instead of 2011.

i6o9tlm,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,JackFisherBooks,"Good points. I do believe there is such a thing as being too tough for your own good, so much so that you start to hurt your team. We saw that last year with Big Ben. I really believe Pittsburgh hurt themselves by sticking with him for as long as they did. I admired his toughness too, but those injuries clearly took a toll on him. And it severely affected his play. The problem was that they just didn't have a capable backup. And in a division with Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson, that's just not going to cut it. And honestly, as skeptical as I am, I would love to see Wentz succeed in Washington. I haven't forgotten how dominant he was for the first part of that 2017 season with the Eagles. He was a legit MVP candidate before he got hurt. And while he's not as old as Big Ben, I do think the amount of injuries he has sustained is just too much. On top of that, just look at what happens to players who go to Washington these days. Both Alex Smith and Ryan Fitzpatrick suffered serious injuries in their first season. For Fitz, it might have been career ending. There's just something wrong with Washington. Every player that goes there only ever thrives briefly before suffering severe setbacks. It's been that way since Dan Snyder bought the team. And at the rate its going, I won't be surprised if that team eventually moves, since nobody wants to give them a new stadium. They're just too consistently bad and the fanbase has just eroded over the years. I've been to that stadium. It's basically a home game for Philly and Washington at this point. But, if Wentz can buck that trend, more power to him. That should earn him MVP consideration by default. But history is working against him. I also believe that the Giants' franchise quarterback isn't on the roster. Jones has shown potential, but he regressed way too much last year and he can no longer stay healthy. I wouldn't be surprised if the Giants took a flyer on a QB in the 2nd or 3rd round tonight. And if they do, I'd be willing to bet money that that QB will be starting games by the end of the season. It may ultimately come down to injury. One thing that I think people overlooked with Dallas last year was how lucky they got with injuries, until the playoffs. It seems Dallas always has such a top-heavy team, which is why they're often on the brink of salary cap hell. Just a few injuries is all it takes to utterly derail their season. Last year, it didn't happen. This year, I think they're gambling it won't happen again and that could backfire horribly. The Eagles might not have the same glut of talent as the Cowboys at the moment. But in terms of depth, I think they have the advantage.",1,2022-04-29 08:04:21,ueb3m7,,3,0,1,6.0,0.5374469757080078,0.3322433531284332,0.1303096562623977,-0.4071373214410557,3.0

Saying the QB market is why Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is revisionist history. The reason Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is because of the cowboys front office not properly handling this situation.

Thus, the cowboys did not overpay for Dak Prescott because it is the QB market that led to him making 40m/yr. That's not their argument. The first person said: ""Dallas overpaid Dak (and Zeke but we're ignoring that part). Now they have to get rid of pieces to afford him"" OP said: ""Dak isn't overpaid that's just the price of a QB now. His contract is not hurting the team."" That's a value assessment based on right now. It's independent of what he could have been had for in the past which is what you're discussing. He's arguing ""if"" Dak is overpaid you're arguing ""why"" Dak is overpaid. > Saying the QB market is why Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is revisionist history. The reason Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is because of the cowboys front office not properly handling this situation. I explained where they misstepped and how those missteps resulted in Dak having the organization by the balls. As a result, the cowboys placed themselves in a position where they paid Dak Prescott 40m/yr. The cowboys did not pay Dak Prescott 40m/yr because of the QB market. So, saying that the QB market is why Dak Prescott is paid 40m/yr is revisionist history. More than one thing can be a factor, they misplayed the negotiations which drug it out and when they finally made a deal ""market"" value had changed. You're painting the two things as mutually exclusive to make yourself right when it's not mutually exclusive. >It is revisionist history because the person making this claim is not giving the actual reason why Dak Prescott was paid 40m/yr. He is revising history and saying that Dak got paid because of the QB market when in reality he got paid because of the cowboys mishandling the entire process. You're adding context and it doesn't contradict what anyone is saying. Neither of you are wrong, he's not revising history. Dak's contract amount is literally a product of the QB market. Dallas' misplayed the QB market and cost themselves money. That doesn't mean he's overpaid if he's producing inline with his contract amount, regardless of if they could have had him for less. >If this doesn’t clear it up, I don’t know what will. And, as I’ve already said, don’t tell people they are wrong or that they are misusing terms when you are the one that is confused. Thanks. I'm not confused at all, but whatever bro you do you.

More like scratch tickets, with higher draft picks being worth tickets with a higher chance of winning. But either way, you're conflating a ""smart"" decision at the time with someone ""losing"" a trade. You can make a ""smart"" decision - as in, the decision that gave you the best odds at the time - and still lose the trade. What you're talking about happens all the time in poker. You look at your hand, calculate some probabilities and make the smartest move you can under the circumstances, without knowing which cards are on the flop. If you make the smart play given your odds, but the other guy ends up getting lucky draw and you lose, is it your *fault* for making the decision you did? No. But did you *lose* the encounter?

Cooper fits that bill reasonably, and by trading for his contract before the WR market blew up, they are in a better spot than they would be just trying to pick up an unrestricted FA WR to be that guy now, if there are any left, or hoping to draft one after losing so many picks.

IMO a more interesting experiment would be to combine Hill with either OTC (Fitzgerald-Spielberger) and/or Harvard charts.

I'm not sure the locker room is going to hold together if you go 1-4 over the next 5, especially if you follow up that awful Broncos game with three more losses. Being 2-5 or 3-6 and things looking like a fourth straight failed season with Saleh is not going to hold well.

He actually throws his weight around without facing consequences, unlike most of those guys (except Deshaun, seriously, what the hell?). In his first real year with the Jets, Aaron has: 1. Lied about being able to return from an Achilles injury, just so he could stay in the spotlight. 2. Skipped mandatory minicamp for a trip to Egypt, then called out his coach for saying it was unexcused. 3. Demanded the team sign his buddies (Hackett, Cobb, Boyle), but took no responsibility once they did. 4. Either got his coach fired or, at best, failed to step in and defend him after he threw a pick that lost them a game. 5. Publicly blamed a teammate for running the wrong route when he didn’t even have to make that throw—and could’ve taken a checkdown for a first down. Aaron Rodgers is a terrible leader. It shouldn’t be considered taboo or “hating” to say that. Sure, the guys you listed are worse, but I never claimed Aaron’s the worst leader ever. Can we stop making excuses for his poor leadership and admit that while he’s talented, he’s also a huge prick who causes chemistry issues?

B) If the Jets don’t want to pay that, they will either have to cut him or he will have to agree to less money. So there are 4 scenarios: 1) No changes are made and he is paid $35M 2) He is cut after this season and does not re-sign with the Jets. 3) He is cut after the season and does re-sign with the Jets. 4) He simply agrees to a contract with less money for the 2025 season (and possibly beyond).

Rodgers already has one foot in the door of the old folks home, and is one embarrassing performance coupled with any semblance of an injury away from hanging it up. They just fired their head coach, demoted their OC. They traded for an elite pass rusher who they can’t/won’t sign. The defense, outside of Sauce, can’t stop anyone. With an eye on the future, beyond the salary cap allocation now tied up by Adams, they gave up a 3rd round pick which may become a 2nd. This move makes sense if they’re 4-2, maybe.

The fact that Saleh was a defensive coach meant that Aaron had arguments to bring in his own OC, which he did, much to the team's detriment.

For Rich it was mainly Covid taking out key players from the other team and last year in 6 of the 9 games Pierce was head coach we played back up QBs some of whom had never played a regular season minute. I think we had to hire Pierce after what happened with Rich and our best players (Crosby and Adams) came out in support of Pierce.

IMO a more interesting experiment would be to combine Hill with either OTC (Fitzgerald-Spielberger) and/or Harvard charts.
