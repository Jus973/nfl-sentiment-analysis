gz4ncfo,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,TipMeinBATtokens,The problem wasn't too much the box being stacked against the Titans.

Dak has only eclipsed 30tds once and has a system around him just as good as tannehill if not better. To me with Watson removed and going off last year it’d go Mahomes, Rodgers, Brady, Wilson, Jackson (because of his running game as well), tannehill, dak, Allen, Murray and then Stafford. Honestly Stafford finally having a great team he could easily move into the top 5. I know people will chime in on “what about mayfield” “where’s Carr” “why isn’t MY qb in there” but this is just my personal top 10. Carr is just outside the 10 and is highly underrated. Murray is a stud but a little overrated because he certainly isn’t a top 5 qb yet no matter who wants to argue it. Lamar is the most polarizing because some say he’s the best some say “he a run back mkay” but the dude is one year removed from a mvp season and then just had his second straight 1,000 season which is already the nfl record for qb’s.

gz5rtm7,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,rforcum,He was 9th in QBR in the regular season and 4th in QBR in the postseason on an absolutely stacked offense. Also he played Green Bay and Kansas City’s defenses which are trash. He threw 3 interceptions in the AFC championship game. His defense shut down Rogers and Mahomes. Pretty much any above average QB would have won the SB on the Bucs this year.,1,2021-05-23 06:43:35,nio78u
gz4x0t7,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,IAmSona,"On the five regular season losses that the Titans had, 3 of those Henry was not able to rush for over 100, and one of those he barely crossed it (Steelers) at 103 yards. Alongside the Ravens loss in the playoffs, Henry also had a pretty terrible game at 40 yards. Each of those games, Tannehill was pretty much asked to step up and carry the games on his back and he averaged 179 yards and 1.6 touchdowns to 1 interception. His QBR on those games was a pretty subpar 84.9, not too good but also not terrible. In fact, out of those losses the only game that Tannehill played in, he only had one game where he threw for over 300 yards and that was the Titans blowout loss to the Browns. I’m not saying that Tannehill is bad, on the contrary he’s easily a top 10 QB in the league, but at least I think I’m confident in saying that he isn’t anywhere elite when it comes to games in which Henry is held in check and he has to put the team on his back.",3,2021-05-22 23:24:07,nio78u
gz47t73,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,PeePee_hole,"I’d agree with a lot of that but Allen being that low is laughable and yeah dak has never gotten 30 tds cause he’s on a run first team and I know tanehill is too but they pass a lot more in the red zone, and Dallas hasn’t had anyone good in the red zone since witten. And people forget last year he was on pace for an mvp season. I think he is hella underrated and I rarely see anyone rate tanehill right, everyone either has him top 5 or out of the top 10. There was a graph of players efficiency and how often they played “out of system” which was like where the play broke down and didn’t go exactly as planned and tanehill Litteraly was the most in system qb, so although he had some of the best efficiency, you gotta look at the context",1,2021-05-22 18:28:07,nio78u

gz5xd6a,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,,"That “stacked offense” featuring 0 pro-bowlers and 0 all pros? They were “stacked” by name recognition, not actual performance in 2020. How was the WFT defense? Top three in the league, torched them for the most yards and second most points they gave up all year. Bucs Defense was trash against a 3rd string backup. I can see why you wouldn’t bring that up. Since when is 26 points and over 300 passing yards “shutting down” anything? That’s not great, especially in the playoffs. They only were able to lock in when it mattered because Brady beat the fuck out of them so badly in the first half he had them playing from behind the whole way, and his interceptions were functional punts. The Packers defense wasn’t trash, it was middle of the pack at worst and finished top 10 in some areas. First in playoff EPA/play. 30+ in four straight playoff games. Most TD passes in NFL history by a Super Bowl-winning QB. Most TD passes in NFL history by a QB on a new team. 11 playoff touchdowns. Possibly the best statistical first half in Super Bowl history.

gz30vpq,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,SkinsHOFChaseYoung,I mean the coaching difference is huge and Baltimore just has better pieces overall. Even with that though Watson threw for almost 5k yards with 30 TD and 7 INT. Also rushed for almost 500 yards. I mean Lamar isn't bad but I don't think he's better than Watson.

Lamar’s not the best passing qb in the league, but he’s pretty close to Tannehill and that’s without AJ Brown. Tannehill is a good QB, credit to him, but seeing Lamar pretty close behind Tannehill in pass stats (before they got Bateman & Wallace) PLUS Lamar’s insane running talent puts him over the top overall as a QB.

gz4zazs,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,IAmSona,"My whole point is that the Titans are a really good team with a historically good running back in Henry. When he is put in place, it’s up to Tannehill to “play heroball” and he can’t, imo Tannehill isn’t the type of quarterback that elevates his teammates which is why he wasn’t able to carry in those losses. Deshaun Watson on the other hand still played ridiculously good and wasn’t able to win on most of those statistically impressive games, so clearly he isn’t the issue with the team. What’s your point? If the Texans would’ve had a better team but Deshaun Watson underperformed, then clearly he’s one of the issues with the team but that’s not the case. I’m not saying that Tannehill is an issue, though, all I’m stating is that he isn’t as elite as people give him credit for. A difference between a great QB and an elite one is defined by the games that come down to the wire, and Tannehill definitely has not had too many of those games in his career, it’s pretty clear that teams attack the running game when it comes to stopping the Titans offense.",3,2021-05-22 23:59:01,nio78u
gz4hpee,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,PeePee_hole,"Well that part about every single one of his stats being top 5 is just false and throwing 53 deep passes all year is gonna cause you to have a very high passing into tight coverage cause it’s a much smaller sample size. Now watch the film and tell me how many of those were thrown into coverage a. Because it was innacurate (cause although he has an amazing completion percentage his adjusted accuracy rate leaves much to be desired) or b. Was his first read. I’m not calling him bad, but he throws to someone besides his first read less often than deshaun Watson goes to massage parlors for something other than a happy ending.",2,2021-05-22 20:11:24,nio78u

gz3u40x,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,WindyCityReturn,I’d disagree he’s been solid for years now once you do that you’ve proven pretty reliable. I love Allen but seriously he has only had one purely great season and we’ve all seen players blow up one year then drop back off badly. I think Allen will be great but you can’t really say he’s more consistent than tannehill when he had two rough years and now one great. Tannehill actually had a good couple years with a terrible dolphins team (coached by Adam gase might I add) and now has been consistent for a few years in a row.,7,2021-05-22 16:17:08,nio78u

People are so obsessed with the “Lamar can’t throw” garbage despite it being objectively wrong, so we find it annoying that the haters can’t even do their research.

gz5p1oo,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gremlin30,"Nothing I said was gymnastics. I’ve never said Lamar is a better passer overall, I gave actual pass stats where he is a better passer. I don’t think Lamar is the most amazing passer in the nfl, but he can throw and the haters like to pretend he can’t. You can be good at running & passing, they’re not mutually exclusive. And yes, in terms of overall talent, Lamar’s running ability makes him way more valuable as a qb than tannehill. I’m not even hating on tannehill, but he’s been in the nfl 3x as long and Lamar’s already made a way bigger impact.",3,2021-05-23 06:15:45,nio78u
gz4jqpf,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gremlin30,"> Lamar does a poor job coming back from behind You either haven’t seen the legendary browns game or just want to hate. I understand you’re mad cuz the ravens beat the Titans this year, and that’s ok cuz we were mad at the Titans last year, but this is a bad take. Ravens fans never say Lamar is perfect- he’s got flaws and things to work on. Lamar himself is a very humble dude and would agree he’s got weaknesses. He’s 24 ffs. Has tannehill won any MVPs? Didn’t think so. Has Tannehill led his team on a 14 game winning streak? Hell no. Henry carries that team as much (more, really) than Lamar carries the Ravens. Hating Lamar for beating your team is ok, but at least have legit criticisms. Let’s look at Tannehill’s mettle- he’s been in the league for 9 years, and he’s only had 2 seasons where his team was above .500. Henry is great in the 4th quarter too, but that doesn’t mean anything when the Ravens held him to only 40 yards. Let’s actually compare passing stats between Lamar & tannehill: - Lamar has a higher completion % (and that’s with crap receivers) - Lamar has a higher avg yds/att - Lamar has the record for most games with a perfect passer rating (tied with Ben) - Lamar’s led the ravens to the playoffs more times than Tannehill even though Tannehill’s already been in the NFL for a decade - Lamar has a higher avg pass yds in the postseason - Lamar led the NFL in pass TDs in 2019 Lamar’s already eclipsed Tannehill in overall talent, and he’s only been in the NFL for 3 years. He’s basically equal to Tannehill in pass ability, and that’s with crap receivers. We haven’t even seen peak Lamar yet. Factor in Lamar’s ridiculous running talent, and he’s overall a better, more well-rounded QB than Tannehill.",3,2021-05-22 20:34:15,nio78u

gz4rbvl,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,,"Tannehill is a really good quarterback and that’s basically where I leave it. He’s been very consistent and he’s very accurate. But it’s easier to be accurate and consistent when the run game is always a threat too. That being said, every time Henry is held to 100 yards or less and Tannehill is forced to throw more we lose. So that’s my hang up on him. Everyone in our fam base worships him because he’s the best QB we’ve had in awhile. But it’s worth noting that when mariota was benched for Tanny there were tons of other adjustments made as well, and if they were made sooner we probably wouldn’t have ever needed Tannehill. But that is an unpopular opinion within our fam base so till stop there. I love Lamar. He’s one of the best to ever do it and I doubt we will see a player like that ever again. I’m a Louisville fan so Lamar will always be royalty here lol. Dude still throws Ls up and talks about Louisville and I love that.",4,2021-05-22 22:06:13,nio78u
gz4wbcn,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,DeliciousRoof0,"Exactly. Lamar has actually excelled when behind i. THE RARE CASE HES BEHIND. He’s almost always ahead. The chiefs games, which the ravens ended up losing obviously, he still gamed brought the ravens closer at the end of games. Not to mention the browns game like said above. He gets down and loses some games like EVERY FUCKING OTHER QB EVER. It’s the nfl it happens. He’s lost so few games and dominated so many it’s easy to focus on his losses. But the sample size is too small. Someone should check the stats but I bet even the Mannings and Bradys of the world don’t win when down more than they lose when down. It’s kind of an unfair criticism of Lamar like they say his losing when the team goes down is unique to him and other qbs do it all the time",7,2021-05-22 23:13:52,nio78u

He’s obviously good and better than then but he’s also just now really had a great year and I think we need to see at least one more before jumping the gun. I think he will be top 10 after this year BUT there’s no guarantee he doesn’t come out having the same problems he had before with accuracy and ends up looking very lack luster. Also that’s not true Cassel looked good his first season ever starting and then actually had a very solid year with Kansas City before dropping off, Josh Freeman was like 27-6 the year before he dropped off which isn’t insanely lower than 37-10. Again, I don’t think he IS those guys but before I put him above people like dak, Stafford and tannehill who have proven themselves in more than 1 year I need to see him stay consistent.",1,2021-05-22 21:59:07,nio78u

And that’s in a Greg Roman offense that is historically god awful in passing. There are stats where tannehill is the better passer, there are stats where Lamar is the better passer. Evaluating them as a QB, Lamar is far more well-rounded and has made a way bigger impact than tannehill ever has despite being in the league for barely 3 years. Tannehill’s been in the nfl for a decade and won 2 playoff games. We can argue very specific pass stats for eternity, but in terms of who’s the better QB overall, it’s Lamar.",-14,2021-05-22 21:22:18,nio78u

They fit the scheme and do what is required fantastically and they play qb but play completely differently. It’s a new world, qbs are going to be more diverse in play style - stop arguing about the same old stats and judge players on how they play in their role",2,2021-05-22 23:17:48,nio78u

But damn y’all are really grasping at straws to argue tannehill is a better qb- I had 1 Titans fan cite me a link to a Titans fan site that argued Tannehill is better cuz he ran a better 2 minute drill...looool. As a ravens fan, I don’t hate tannehill at all. He’s a decent player, but Titans fans def hype him up too much imo. I like comparison debates cuz they’re fun, I just wish a lot of Titans fans had better reasoning. There’s def pass stats where tannehill is better than Lamar, but a lot of Titans fans want to ignore Lamar’s run talent putting him over the top in overall qb talent. Honestly we really dgaf about the titans, we just find your fanbase annoying cuz of the constant trash takes about Lamar. There’s def valid criticisms of him as a qb, but if you’re citing a 2 min drill off a Titans fan website...that’s why we don’t like Titans fans lol.",0,2021-05-23 06:38:35,nio78u
gz4mfp3,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gremlin30,"PFF is trash. Personally I think tannehill is a good qb, prob a lil underrated, but cherry-picking stats from your own website won’t make a winning argument. Is tannehill a bad passer? Absolutely not. Are there stats where he’s better than Lamar? Sure. Are there stats where Lamar is better? Yes. Lamar’s very close to tannehill in pass ability, and that’s with very little experience and not much to work with in his receivers. As an overall Qb, Lamar is better.",2,2021-05-22 21:05:29,nio78u
gz4klz3,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,PeePee_hole,"All good I already tried to respond lmao Ok I will admit me saying he adds nothing is not the right wording. He adds stability and a solid passer who is very consistent and that is an amazing thing. What I meant is he doesn’t add anything special. He doesn’t add the insane game iq of Brady, or the rocket arm of Allen or Mahomes. He doesn’t have the crazy legs of Lamar or the shiftiness of Wilson and Watson. He doesn’t have that “it” factor that an elite qb needs. When scheming against the titans a team doesn’t need to change their playstyle to adapt to him. He runs the offense exactly as vrable wants, and doesn’t make mistakes. That’s why the team started 2-4 cause mariota made a lot of mistakes. So when I say he doesn’t add anything I mean more that he doesn’t hurt the offense but he isn’t the type of guy you can build your offense around cause there’s nothing insanely special about him. Like imo his best trait is his consistency, which yes is exactly what is needed in that offense. But when I think of a qbs skill, what I’m imagining is if every qb was put on a team that is completely average but made exactly for them, who would be the best. I can’t see tanehill leading an average team to be top 5 more than I can see Brady(who has many times) Lamar(who has a below average offense and makes it elite) Allen (who is in a similar boat to lamar although he does have an amazing wr, still adds more to the offense) Mahomes, Rodgers, Wilson, and watson (who will be excellent next year. On the prison team where he belongs). I do believe he could lead that team to be top 10, but I value actual skill over production and I don’t think tanehill is a top 5 most skilled qb. I think he is 9th, 8th excluding Watson. And I’m not just talking about raw talent, I’m including mental talent and how refined and all that. Cause tbh production comes just as much from the system and players around the qb as it does from him, skill is really what separates the best from the rest",1,2021-05-22 20:44:05,nio78u
gz4r47b,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,PeePee_hole,"I mean everyone looks good in New England behind Brady so that’s not saying much and keenum looked good on the box score but a deeper look at his stats and he really didnt. And I do understand what you’re saying but Allen was an mvp front runner this year. Stafford has shown what he can do and although he’ll take a step up this year, it’s not as much as Allen can do. Allen has way more potential than Stafford and Tanehill and last year showed that he has refined himself. I agree sole qbs do fall off but usually it’s cause their season is clearly a fluke when looking at it, either like Wentz where he only was good on 3rd and 4th or with the qbs you mentioned who still had glaring flaws. This off-season Allen managed to eliminate almost all of those so unless he somehow redevelops them he is top 7. And the difference is he learned and fixed it and you can see it in his mechanics while many of those other guys covered up their issues. I agree about dak though he’s wildly underrated and I have him above Allen",1,2021-05-22 22:03:30,nio78u
gz4mbiz,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,zkiteman,"I 100% agree with everything you’re saying. He doesn’t have an insane skill set, but he brings consistency and great passing ability. I also never thought he was too 5 as someone earlier in the thread said, despite his stats supporting that. I’m just glad we were able to clarify enough to go from “he doesn’t add anything to the team” to he’s “a top 10 QB”, especially considering finding a multi-year starter at QB is difficult enough, let alone finding a top 10 one. My only refute is that just because his play doesn’t jump out at you like the other guys you mentioned, doesn’t mean he doesn’t have an “it” factor. Leadership and winning can be an “it” factor. Brady was not known for his crazy game IQ for quite some time early in his career. He was known for winning at all costs. In no way am I comparing the two, just using him as an example. He probably won’t ever win MVP, but he is capable of winning them a SB.",1,2021-05-22 21:04:07,nio78u
gz5pmzx,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gremlin30,"Lol that’s a terrible argument. Of course he has more overall yds and TDs, he has like 100 more attempts. It would be a terrible take if I said Lamar is a better qb than Peyton Manning cuz he has more rush yards. If you look at overal completion, Lamar has a higher %. You’re not understanding my point. There are stats where Lamar is a better passer, there are stats where tannehill is a better passer. My point is that they’re very close in overall passing stats, and that’s in a ravens offense that dgaf about passing and has trash receivers.

And Sammy Watkins...the guy who has had under 700 yards every year since 2015? Idk man, unless Bateman is a top tier WR talent, it’s still not elite.",10,2021-05-22 13:42:20,nio78u

Julio isnt an unproven commodity he leads NFL HISTORY in yards per game and if you need any indicator on how good he is look at how players from every team in the NFL are trying to recruit him. He is #1 wherever he goes until he shows he cant do it. The only exception atm to me and I know im biased would be Arizona cuz Nuke is that guy now.,-1,2021-05-30 09:21:50,nocsc7
h0015s0,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,FreestyleKneepad,"Y'know what, as far as what the media was suggesting, that's a fair point. Chalk it up to being in the middle of the whirlwind and getting 3 QB names seared into the crevices of my brain for a month. I can for sure say it was 80-90% coverage about ""The 49ers are taking Mac Jones"" though. And given that the FO came out and said that: * They didn't try as hard for Stafford as the media suggested * They didn't try as hard for Deshaun Watson as the media suggested * They didn't try as hard for Aaron Rodgers as the media suggested * They didn't try as hard for Joe Flacco as the media suggested * They didn't try as hard for Mac Jones as the media suggested I'm way more inclined to believe the Niners FO over basically anyone in sports media right now, at least over Niners matters. The media grasps at straws and the Niners FO doesn't leak. I'm sure of these two things at this point. To pull it back to the thread topic, does this mean they're accurate about the Titans going hard after Julio, or that they're accurate that the Titans are the most likely landing zone? I have no idea. But I sure as hell don't trust reports until the new contract is inked. I hope you can see why.",4,2021-05-30 11:43:20,nocsc7

h0osbju,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,The1SatanFears,"The Texans essentially did this when they traded Brock Osweiler to the Browns. You take a shitty player on a bad contract and a second round pick, we end up with cap space. That said, if something like this did become possible, I still think the original team should be responsible for the value. I’m kinda struggling putting into words, but I don’t want to see the cheap ass Bengals owner trade away half his cap so he can have tons of cheap rookies or UDFAs. Or like, if you’re trading cap space, you’re also trading some of your market share from the profits of the NFL. If you’re putting less in the pot, you should get a smaller return. Idk if any of that makes sense, but as a Saints fan, I’d love to trade for some cap space right about now.",285,2021-06-05 07:17:57,nswdv2
h0p1ucu,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,srsh,"Love this idea. However, I would make some minor tweaks so teams that put themselves into cap hell don't escape easily. * Salary cap trades are only valid after the NFL draft. Team in bad cap situation is still hindered when competing against good cap space teams when FA starts. * Making it post-draft means teams will always be able to sign their draft picks (like this year Falcons). * Team is only allowed to make only 1 or 2 cap-space trades in offseason.

h0srcu1,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,Cheap-Lifeguard5762,"When trades are made, sometimes financials go with in the trade which allows cap space due to whatever arrangements. It can be done. No need to allow a direct trade. The players lose more personal value if their contracts can just be traded around for space and teams will make a ton of space and then in week 8 go hog wild.

h0ovt7t,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,Curonjr,"Tacking on to that one point that most Brady haters make is that he played under-market value which was unfair and gave them an advantage as they could build more around him. Now imagine a situation where he can play under market value and get others to buy in that way they could trade their cap space to other teams directly for players who would help them win a Superbowl and would also be willing to play under market value. This way you don't need to give up draft picks or players, just cap space that you didn't need to use anyways. This could be abused pretty easily if players care more about winning than they do money. I think if you had a situation like this then you would need to say teams have to use up 90% of their cap each year before trading any leftover cap space away. (Right now it seems like an average of 89% spent over 4 years, so I just barely raised it and made it for each year to prevent taking players for ""nothing"").

h11pdpf,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,Kalanar,"NFL has two types of spending. Cash spending and cap spending. You can think of cap spending like monopoly money in the NFL game. At it's most basic rule you have to use 1 cap dollar for every $1 dollar you spend on a player however there are ways to delay this. The most common being a signing bonus. In that case you can pay a player $20 million in real money but instead of having to use 20 million in cap space you can use 4 million in cap space a year over 5 years. It still equals that 20 million in cap space it just delays it. If you cut or trade the player before all 5 years are up however all that cap space you still owe the NFL advances up to be due in the current year. This is what the Falcons are seeing with Julio. They owe the NFL 23,250,000 cap space(7,750,000 X 3 years). This isn't actual money being paid to Julio it's already been paid to him, the Falcons simply were delaying paying the cap space for it. Since he was traded the NFL wants all that cap space now. However another rule the NFL has is if the cut/trade takes place after June 1st you don't have to pay it all back this year it can be spread out over two years. Which is why the Falcons were waiting to trade him. In that case the 7,750,000 in cap space they owe the NFL this year stays the same but the final two years(15,500,000) advance to hit their cap next year. It still totals the 23,250,000 in total cap space they owe the NFL.",5,2021-06-08 09:44:57,nv6gbo

But Tannehill and Henry are both top 5 at their position IMO whereas the chiefs do not have anything resembling a top 5 rb (due to Khunt punting). So it comes down to how you weight the RB play.

All that to say - if you're run game is only going to give you 2 or 3 yards at best like some - it's hard to get motivated to block.

I do think they could've stayed where they were and pick up Kyle Hamilton but this was a fine move regardless. Basically trading their second 1st round pick for AJ Brown was a fantastic move considering Brown is likely better right now than any other WR in this draft will be in the future. Giving up a 1st and then having to pay him 25 million is a steep price to pay but I do think it was worth it because imo Brown is a top 10 WR in the league and should immediately come in and make the Eagles better from the jump.

Garrett Wilson, Drake London, Jameson Williams, Treylon Burks, Chris Olave, Jahan Dotson and George Pickens are all players who I think have All Pro caliber potential and will be playing as well as or better than any other WR in the league at some point over the next few years. At the very least, I think all 7 of those guys will make the Pro Bowl atleast once by the time their careers are over. Justyn Ross, Khalil Shakir, John Metchie, Christian Watson, David Bell, Jalen Tolbert, Alec Pierce, Romeo Doubs, Wan'Dale Robinson, Skyy Moore and Jaivon Heiligh are all players I think have Pro Bowl level potential and will be solid players for their respective teams for several years.

i6nt8rd,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,JackFisherBooks,"True, but a better QB is the overriding factor there. That said, Philly has shown in the past that they know how to surround their QBs with capable talent and a good system. Nick Foles might not have been on the same level as most top tier QBs, but he had a very capable cast of receivers and tight ends around him. And he, along with Wentz before he got hurt, was able to carry that team to the playoffs. Philly just hasn't had that cast of talent in a while. But AJ Brown will definitely help. I still believe Jalen Hurts can elevate his game enough to compete with teams like Dallas. But I still think they're a few pieces away. I'm also not confident Dallas can pick up where they left off. Every time Dallas has a winning season, they follow it up by losing key players and regressing badly.

Made it just as far or farther than . Kyler murray . Justin herbert . Mac jones . Baker mayfield . Kirk cousins . Russell wilson . Tua . Sam darnold . Dak prescott Idk the goal is to win games and we did that with him as the leader of the team. We argubaly had a worse roster than most of guys listed above. If making the playoffs is so ez why are all these guys sitting at home? We went from 4-12 to 9-8 and a playoff appearance. This is with a brand new coaching staff and a qb in his first year starting. If hurts wasnt a second round pick everyone would agree this was a good year. Wentz 2016 - 16 starts 16td, 14 int, 79.3 rating, 3782 yards, 46 rushes, 150 yards Hurts 2021 - 15 starts 87.2 rating, 16td, 9 int, 139 rushes, 784yds rushing, 3114 passing If anything hurts played slightly better than rookie wentz and had a better record. I bring this up because everyone wasnt quick to turn on wentz because of his draft profile. In reality you need to just give young qbs time and surrounded them with actual talent. In 2016 we had garbage defense, good line, and no wrs. Wentz and the team looked competent but still struggled. We literally saw the same thing happen this year. Im happy the front office are letting it play out because Hurts has shown flashes and our run game was legitimately historic this year.

i6nvwmf,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,moesus81,"That’s fair and Dak is significantly better than Hurts right now (and Wentz obviously, since I mentioned Washington) The SB team was just magical and everything just fell into place that year. The defense held ATL to 10 and MIN to 7. It’s hard to lose games in that situation, even though they were real close to losing the ATL game. Luckily Foles was able to step up in the SB when Brady was just absolutely shredding us for 500 yards. Ertz was our leading pass catcher that year, the top 2 WR (Algholor and Jeffery) didn’t have huge years. They had 119 catches for 1,557 yards and 17 TD combined. AJ Brown is a significant upgrade over both of those guys. Philly’s OL and DL is better than Dallas as well but QB is just too important in this era. Hopefully Hurts can improve with a much better cast around him. I like Schultz a lot but who is going to be the #2 WR while Gallup is out? ACL isn’t a huge deal anymore but it might take him a while to play at the same level as well. I’m also not too confident in Dallas this year but the NFL is so unpredictable, so we’ll see. If Washington’s D is like it was 2 years ago and Wentz doesn’t completely choke when it matters, they will be a problem as well. NFC East is open for the taking aside from NYG. Looking into 23/24 and Dak’s $100M cap hit those 2 years is rough.",1,2022-04-29 06:24:24,ueb3m7

The impact adding AJ Brown has should be to immediately make things simpler. You can't double team all three of them. No one was good enough last year to be the third piece of an effective slot safety net. This year is different. I wouldn't be surprised if Reagor is more comfortable in the slot like Agholor in 2017, but if he isn't then we still have Paschal to try out there. And if Hurts can't keep up with the NFL with these toys, he will never be the guy. Assuming quality QB play, this is a division winning offense and dark horse for a solid playoff run. Anything less, and we use our extra picks next year to cash in on a QB.

i6nyeu4,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,JackFisherBooks,"I agree. That Super Bowl run by Philly was truly magical. That team just had everything clicking in all the right ways. That's not something you can repeat. Foles just got hot at the right time. And to date, I've never seen Hurts get hot in the same way. But Hurts has never had someone like AJ Brown to throw to. And if the defense steps up, he might not have to win so many games on his own. I think that's key because, unless you're Tom Brady, you just can't win ball games like that. I'm also not at all confident that Washington will make it work with Wentz. In fact, I suspect that team will completely collapse halfway through the season and will be in the running for the number one overall pick. Their defense just fell apart last year. Plus, Wentz just can't stay healthy. I saw this happen last year with Fitzpatrick. Washington was hyping him up all offseason, hoping he could win with a dominant defense. Then, the defense regressed and Fitz got hurt in the first quarter of the first game. That doesn't bode well for Wentz. I honestly don't see him starting all 16 games in this season or any season at this point. The NFC East will be competitive, but I think it'll be between Dallas and Philly. I also think the Giants might take a step forward. I think Daniel Jones is no world-beater, but he hasn't had a lot of weapons to work with, let alone a defense. Maybe this year finally starts to change that. Guess we'll have to wait and see.",3,2022-04-29 06:43:27,ueb3m7

i6nsgmx,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,,"Yep, the Packers trade was better than the Titans due to age alone. That's one of the reasons this hurts so much. AJ Brown is still so young. The Titans only got 3 seasons out of him. The Packers got 8 out of Adams. Adams is going to decline, maybe not this season, but soon. AJ's best seasons are almost certainly ahead of him (barring injury). I'm a St. Louis native and the AJ Brown trade makes me feel like I did when Pujols signed with the Angels. It's fucking gut-wrenching. But it's actually worse than that trade was. It's more like if Pujols had signed with the Angels in 2005 instead of 2011. I've been an Oiler/Titans fan since the football Cardinals left St. Louis and AJ is the *only* game-changing receiver the franchise has had in that time...more than 30 years. This sucks.",6,2022-04-29 05:57:09,ueb3m7
i6o9tlm,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,JackFisherBooks,"Good points. I do believe there is such a thing as being too tough for your own good, so much so that you start to hurt your team. We saw that last year with Big Ben. I really believe Pittsburgh hurt themselves by sticking with him for as long as they did. I admired his toughness too, but those injuries clearly took a toll on him. And it severely affected his play. The problem was that they just didn't have a capable backup. And in a division with Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson, that's just not going to cut it. And honestly, as skeptical as I am, I would love to see Wentz succeed in Washington. I haven't forgotten how dominant he was for the first part of that 2017 season with the Eagles. He was a legit MVP candidate before he got hurt. And while he's not as old as Big Ben, I do think the amount of injuries he has sustained is just too much. On top of that, just look at what happens to players who go to Washington these days. Both Alex Smith and Ryan Fitzpatrick suffered serious injuries in their first season. For Fitz, it might have been career ending. There's just something wrong with Washington. Every player that goes there only ever thrives briefly before suffering severe setbacks. It's been that way since Dan Snyder bought the team. And at the rate its going, I won't be surprised if that team eventually moves, since nobody wants to give them a new stadium. They're just too consistently bad and the fanbase has just eroded over the years. I've been to that stadium. It's basically a home game for Philly and Washington at this point. But, if Wentz can buck that trend, more power to him. That should earn him MVP consideration by default. But history is working against him. I also believe that the Giants' franchise quarterback isn't on the roster. Jones has shown potential, but he regressed way too much last year and he can no longer stay healthy. I wouldn't be surprised if the Giants took a flyer on a QB in the 2nd or 3rd round tonight. And if they do, I'd be willing to bet money that that QB will be starting games by the end of the season. It may ultimately come down to injury. One thing that I think people overlooked with Dallas last year was how lucky they got with injuries, until the playoffs. It seems Dallas always has such a top-heavy team, which is why they're often on the brink of salary cap hell. Just a few injuries is all it takes to utterly derail their season. Last year, it didn't happen. This year, I think they're gambling it won't happen again and that could backfire horribly. The Eagles might not have the same glut of talent as the Cowboys at the moment. But in terms of depth, I think they have the advantage.",1,2022-04-29 08:04:21,ueb3m7

That all being said, they’re just numbers at the combine which are not predictive just indicative. For reference as a relative value 0-10 for all WRs that have entered the draft he ranks at a 5.72(see Kent Platte’s RAS) and Brown is at 8.71.

But on a more serious note, this gives a ton of flexibility of what to do in the draft now. We could either go BPA with our first pick and go depth with WR later. It also allows us to not have to focus as heavily on a deep threat player like Olave or Williams in favor of a bigger body like London or Wilson. This may ultimately be a ""trading trash"" scenario of swapping OBJ for Cooper, but it's better than putting all our hopes on a first round rookie WR with no other options.",1,2022-03-12 12:41:56,tco8og

Year 3: Great year. Pitsburgh kissed our asses and we were a missed helmet to helmet hit from the conference game. Year 4: He started the season right where he left off in year 3, passing in big volume with amazing plays, only to injure his shoulder because some WR didnt run his route. It took a couple weeks but baker could handle that and played okay later.

Also, OP is dismissing ""not betting at all"" as one of the choices. You can make a smart decision within a game that gives you 51% chance of winning (imagine these are the highest odds possible), but if you decide to *make* that bet and end up losing your life savings, two things are true: * You made the best decision possible within the game, so you're decision *within the game* was sound * You made a bad decision to play the game and take a huge risk in the first place",-2,2022-03-24 08:47:31,tmfmeb

Cooper fits that bill reasonably, and by trading for his contract before the WR market blew up, they are in a better spot than they would be just trying to pick up an unrestricted FA WR to be that guy now, if there are any left, or hoping to draft one after losing so many picks. As things played out, they have reason to be happier with the move (before he's played a snap of course) than when it happened because they otherwise have a huge hole on offense with few options.

If i had to order that list from worst to best: * Mike Williams * Amari Cooper * Chris Godwin * DJ Moore * Keenan Allen * Michael Thomas That's considering the last 4ish years for all of those players.

But that contract looks really good right now, and if he bounces back from injury and plays like he has he's going to be the best value for a WR in the NFL",0,2022-03-23 14:42:18,tl1beo

Of course, the fat rapist asshole would often gingerly walk after a particularly egregious interception to play up on how hurt he was or defend interceptions by saying he had to take chances to give his team an opportunity to win. I don't recall him taking accountability for his in-game mistakes, nor talking much about what a liability he was to his team at the end of his career... maybe he ""earned the right"" to gloss over that as well.

All those guys were busts with off-field issues (except maybe Jamarcus, who was just lazy). Want to know why I think Aaron is almost as bad, but in a different way? He actually throws his weight around without facing consequences, unlike most of those guys (except Deshaun, seriously, what the hell?). In his first real year with the Jets, Aaron has: 1. Lied about being able to return from an Achilles injury, just so he could stay in the spotlight. 2. Skipped mandatory minicamp for a trip to Egypt, then called out his coach for saying it was unexcused. 3. Demanded the team sign his buddies (Hackett, Cobb, Boyle), but took no responsibility once they did. 4. Either got his coach fired or, at best, failed to step in and defend him after he threw a pick that lost them a game. 5. Publicly blamed a teammate for running the wrong route when he didn’t even have to make that throw—and could’ve taken a checkdown for a first down. Aaron Rodgers is a terrible leader. It shouldn’t be considered taboo or “hating” to say that. Sure, the guys you listed are worse, but I never claimed Aaron’s the worst leader ever. Can we stop making excuses for his poor leadership and admit that while he’s talented, he’s also a huge prick who causes chemistry issues?

Raiders should be going all-in on picks and then try and rollover unused cap when they want to start a contention window. What are they going to do with the unused cap next off-season? Throw money at some vets to chase 8 wins? They need to draft a QB and should be focusing on a contention window in 3 years.

ls2ee03,Davante Adams,Raiders,Jets,DilligentBass,"Outside of his whiny demeanour rubbing off on everyone. Supposedly he lost a lot of support in the locker room when he was filming his series for Netflix. The team thought he was over dramatic and putting himself over winning games. Him and his family ripping into to Jimmy G was looked at as snake like, as bad as Jimmy was at playing the game he’s always been beloved in the locker room. Our coach said all healthy players will play a series in the preseason. Davante came out the next day and said he never plays in the preseason and shouldn’t have to. The day after he had a “hamstring injury” during a walk thru and didn’t play in the preseason game. Just a lot of typical WR diva shit that was pissing everyone off but he wasn’t as vocal about it as Diggs and maintained a good image with all his public appearances. Which didn’t help some on our team from thinking he was selfish and two faced. Also another major thing. He was gone from camp for 2 weeks for the birth of his child. Now I’ll absolutely admit family comes before everything. But we were in the middle of installing a brand new offense and having a QB battle to see who would be leading the team. Having your star WR1 absent for that long in that critical moment was also not looked at as a player being bought in. For reference our backup up safety that just got bumped to the starting role missed exactly 1 day for the birth of his kid and the average around the league is 2 days… not weeks. In a different state in the middle of training camp. This was also the first year since he’s been here that he wasn’t voted a captain by his teammates and there were rumblings about him not taking that too well.",4,2024-10-15 10:09:27,1g49eqc

They don't have as you mentioned much room for error (and I don't expect much from this year if im honest with myself), but they can build off of this. One thing that its lost in Rodgers injury last year, was that that was supposed to be a feeling out year.

B) If the Jets don’t want to pay that, they will either have to cut him or he will have to agree to less money. So there are 4 scenarios: 1) No changes are made and he is paid $35M 2) He is cut after this season and does not re-sign with the Jets. 3) He is cut after the season and does re-sign with the Jets. 4) He simply agrees to a contract with less money for the 2025 season (and possibly beyond).

ls1nw4r,Davante Adams,Raiders,Jets,Steel_Penguin_,"This is an example of why the Jets franchise will stay cursed. This is such an illogical move considering the current landscape for them. No doubt whatsoever Adams is an elite receiver still. No doubt Rodgers can still win games, though I’d argue he’s not quite as elite as some would still say. But the jets are 2-4 currently. Davante Adams is 32 years old and comes with a hefty price tag, the remainder of which the Jets volunteered to pay 100%. Rodgers already has one foot in the door of the old folks home, and is one embarrassing performance coupled with any semblance of an injury away from hanging it up. They just fired their head coach, demoted their OC. They traded for an elite pass rusher who they can’t/won’t sign. The defense, outside of Sauce, can’t stop anyone. With an eye on the future, beyond the salary cap allocation now tied up by Adams, they gave up a 3rd round pick which may become a 2nd. This move makes sense if they’re 4-2, maybe. But makes zero sense now. Anyways, in the wonderful words of Bart Scott, “CANT WAIT” to see how it all looks in Pittsburgh this Sunday night.",2,2024-10-15 07:47:38,1g48ini

The fact that Saleh was a defensive coach meant that Aaron had arguments to bring in his own OC, which he did, much to the team's detriment.

ls455jo,Davante Adams,Raiders,Jets,GucciGecko,"You think the Raiders would've done well with Rich as head coach? I think it'd be the same as we're seeing right now with Pierce. Both are passionate guys but we've seen Pierce struggle with strategic decisions at key points in the game (see the Chargers game this year and several games last year). I think the league doesn't see him as head coach material either otherwise a team would've given him a shot already. I also felt both Rich and Pierce looked better than they were because of Covid and injuries down the stretch. For Rich it was mainly Covid taking out key players from the other team and last year in 6 of the 9 games Pierce was head coach we played back up QBs some of whom had never played a regular season minute. I think we had to hire Pierce after what happened with Rich and our best players (Crosby and Adams) came out in support of Pierce. I think Rich might have been better than Pierce because we had Bradley as DC (and with his HC experience maybe he could've helped him a little) and Mayock drafted well his last year here. He would've had to find a good OC, it wasn't Olson, Gruden was the one calling the offensive plays. I 100% agree that Carr hasn't been the same since breaking his leg and I felt we should've started a rebuild earlier. We still haven't drafted a QB in the 1st or 2nd since we took Carr.

The Bengals 5th this year is worth 12 points. So if you subtract that from the value of a high second say the LA Chargers fifth pick in the second which is worth 162, you get 150. If you add both sixteenth picks together (admittedly owned by different teams at the moment) in the 2nd and 4th you get 146. So your deal is arguably *worse* than what I proposed.

I think at the end of the day this just means Tee stays where he is at. I think the Bengals are happy with that and I am too.

They want a receiver, go find your own,"" Tobin said at the 2023 NFL Combine.",2,2024-03-13 09:39:13,1bczvzw
kur7ze1,Joe Mixon,Bengals,Texans,Accomplished-Cat3996,"Mike Brown wouldn't cave. He didn't cave to Jonah last year and he won't cave to Tee this year. He did trade Carson Palmer, but only after the Raiders gave up a 1st and 2nd for him. > He’s not gonna lose out on much if any money. In what world is $20 million not much money? We've already seen the team play with just JChase and the Bengals were fine. It isn't like they will be desperate. Maybe MAYBE if their are injuries or losses but honestly, he hasn't even said he'll hold out. I very much doubt he will in part because he knows the Bengals hold all the cards. That isn't to say a new deal won't happen or that Tee can't pressure him, but the idea that Tee is going to hold out while on the franchise tag is extremely far fetched.",1,2024-03-13 16:28:11,1bczvzw

They were gonna just cut him, it was basically just the Texans slipping the Bengals a fiver under the table to get first dibs so they didn't have to fight with other teams to sign him.",242,2024-03-14 06:49:17,1bel8ht

kuu2sq9,Joe Mixon,Bengals,Texans,bauboish,"The Texans also took on $6mil of Mixon salary from the trade and saved $3mil from trading Collins. So they also lost $3mil of capspace from these deals. $3mil isn't a lot, but it's high-end backup/low-end starter money.",52,2024-03-14 06:57:03,1bel8ht
