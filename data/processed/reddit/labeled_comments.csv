I mean maybe it hasn't been that way super recently but Njoku is amazing at dropping at least 2 catches almost every game. Braylon Edwards was amazing at making the most unbelievebly difficult contested catches ever....wide open you might as well not even throw him the ball.

ku3tfe7,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,beerguy_etcetera,"I would think a team that needs a receiver that has draft capital to begin with, it would be a low risk trade.

ku3m79g,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,,It's also because of how good he was in college and how highly drafted he was in a good WR class. He's been fine but hasn't lived up to the hype for sure.,57,2024-03-09 09:48:11,1ban2kv,1

ku3m11e,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,crastle,"I'm not sure how many other teams would've given you more. There's not too many teams who *need* a WR2 that only gets 750ish yards, 2 TDs, is known for giving up on routes, and is due for a new contract after this year. If you don't think you have a chance to compete this year, and you don't want to keep him after this contract, then get what you can for him. I like this move for you guys. People are comparing this to when the Browns got Amari Cooper for only a 6th, but Jeudy has never been as good as Cooper. You did good. I'm proud of you.",72,2024-03-09 09:47:13,1ban2kv,1

ku50j5q,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,Balrogkicksass,Last year was his breakout year Browns fans were waiting for and alot of it just had to do with other options not being there (injuries) and them finally utilizing him but in years past he would go out and be the most dominant player for a drive and then never catch a ball again or we would only use him for screen passes and nothing else.,1,2024-03-09 14:37:39,1ban2kv,1

ku3p0pf,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,SirLuciousL,"Film analysts that actually chart WR routes are always saying that Jeudy’s reputation as this great route runner with fans is a complete myth. He looks great on social media videos because he runs freestyle type, flashy, triple move routes that look cool in practice, but take way too long to develop in real games. He’s an atrociously bad zone route runner because he’s terrible with timing his routes and has a poor film study work ethic.

I don’t think this is some amazing trade but I think for the value and the potential comp pick if he plays well it makes sense.
