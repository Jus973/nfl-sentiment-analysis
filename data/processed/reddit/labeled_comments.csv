ku3tfe7,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,beerguy_etcetera,"I would think a team that needs a receiver that has draft capital to begin with, it would be a low risk trade.

ku3m11e,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,crastle,"I'm not sure how many other teams would've given you more. There's not too many teams who *need* a WR2 that only gets 750ish yards, 2 TDs, is known for giving up on routes, and is due for a new contract after this year. If you don't think you have a chance to compete this year, and you don't want to keep him after this contract, then get what you can for him. I like this move for you guys. People are comparing this to when the Browns got Amari Cooper for only a 6th, but Jeudy has never been as good as Cooper. You did good. I'm proud of you.",72,2024-03-09 09:47:13,1ban2kv,1

ku50j5q,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,Balrogkicksass,Last year was his breakout year Browns fans were waiting for and alot of it just had to do with other options not being there (injuries) and them finally utilizing him but in years past he would go out and be the most dominant player for a drive and then never catch a ball again or we would only use him for screen passes and nothing else.,1,2024-03-09 14:37:39,1ban2kv,1

ku3p0pf,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,SirLuciousL,"Film analysts that actually chart WR routes are always saying that Jeudy’s reputation as this great route runner with fans is a complete myth. He looks great on social media videos because he runs freestyle type, flashy, triple move routes that look cool in practice, but take way too long to develop in real games. He’s an atrociously bad zone route runner because he’s terrible with timing his routes and has a poor film study work ethic.

For example, in your combined chart, pick 76 has the same value of picks 101 and 102 ---- yet you're not seeing that sort of trade made on draft day. 200 is somehow worth 240 and 241 and 242 and 243 and 244 and 245 and 246.",16,2024-03-17 08:59:22,1bh03gs,3

Hill and Johnson both used the same method for calculating values: historical trades. The difference is pretty much only the data used. Hill used only players after the rookie wage scale, and Johnson was made before that. So basically all you have really done is create a chart that sits between Johnson and Hill. IMO a more interesting experiment would be to combine Hill with either OTC (Fitzgerald-Spielberger) and/or Harvard charts. OTC measures value based on average second contract, Harvard measures value based on average career AV. In that sense, you'd be getting an average between what teams have historically traded those picks for (Hill) and what a players' actual return is, which is sorry of the reason these charts exist anyway.",1,2024-03-18 04:52:08,1bh03gs,3

No owner is going to guarantee every last dollar to the player. Haslem wanted to make a splash and he pulled out the checkbook for Watson to make it happen and it was unprecedented. And now every other owner has said between themselves never again for the standard it’ll set moving forward. Why is Rodgers not going to retire/can get traded? Because he’s due $50 million this year in real cash dollars, his cap hit is $40 million. No matter what happens Rodgers will get his $50 million paid to him but the cap hit will be adjusted to make it work with New York. Gee how come?

This is what you have to do to pay a generational QB the money a generational QB should make while remaining competitive.

There's a good chance you will end up with a negatively valued contract. 3. Giving away 5 picks + undertaking a slightly positive (AT BEST) value contract = profit????

I don’t know what they envision. Probably the best of a bad situation for them I suppose. The Dolphins give up a lot to bring in a 28 year old speed guy, who they are going to make the highest paid ever at his position, while having question marks in a ton of spots… and now it’s going to be harder to move in from Tua with less capital, which looks to be the most likely scenario based on what we’ve seen so far.

Leading receivers those games were week 1 Sammy Watkins 198 yards Week 2 Demarcus Robins 172 yards week 3 Mecole Hardman 97 yards (rookie year) week 4 Kelce with 85 yards (Mahomes threw for 315 and six guys had 30-85 yards) week 5 was the loss to Indi when Mahomes got stepped on by his offensive lineman and limped the entire game but the leading receiver was Byron Pringle with 103 yards. So my point is as long as we have Mahomes I'm not too worried about winning. He has won without Hill before and it's not like Juju and Kelce are a bad 1-2 combo.

i1tkcqd,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,stormy2587,I sort of agree. I think to some extent giving up a lot of picks can be more harmful to a team long term than giving up like a single pick in the top 100. The draft is to some extent just dumb luck and finding contributors in the later rounds has been huge for some franchises. And not having those picks reduces the odds of doing that. Like Tyreek Hill was a 5th round pick. The chiefs finding an elite speed receiver in the 5th in 2016 was a huge part of them unlocking the high scoring offense starting in 2017. I don’t think this is a bad trade for miami per se just that I think number of picks in a draft matters to some extent. The Dolphins aren’t the most complete roster in the nfl and they just spent 6 picks on a single player. I think most teams would hope to net 3 contributors from those picks.

He can transform simple underneath routes into huge gains thanks to his speed and escapability, and of course he can get the deep ball too. He takes stress off of a guy who doesn't really react to stress and pressure well. He makes defenders focus on him and that opens options for mahomes to hit the other receivers. There is no other receiver on the roster like him and I'm not sure there is one in the draft this year either.

Richard Seymour was solid but he was a 30 year old and then signed pretty reasonable extensions and continued to play well (pro bowler in 2010 and 2011 and second team all pro in 2011) for the Raiders so it was a fair trade. He's literally the closest thing to a HOF defensive player you've traded. Wilfork was a stud but you just let him go in free agency at the end of his time. Kyle Van Noy you traded for so he wasn't homegrown and he just walked at the end. Willie McGinest was released. Lawyer Milloy was released. Ty Law was released. Ty Warren was released. Teddy Bruschi retired as a Patriot. Rodney Harrison retired as a Patriot. Asante Samuel walked in free agency. Malcolm Butler walked in free agency. Trey Flowers walked in free agency. Hightower is likely leaving in free agency. McCourty has been a long term patriot. Patrick Chung left for a year and came back in free agency. Literally the only guy I can remotely think of that you traded that was on defense that was remotely close to a HOF is Mike Vrabel. Chandler Jones was for a second round pick and Gilmore a sixth round pick. Those are literally the only two other guys you traded... and got no where near the haul of Hill and neither are remotely as good as Hill.

Sports illustrated didn't even make a note of his pick. PFF didn't mention him in their analysis either other than listing him there as a running back.

It seems it will be tough for Hill to crack the roster as anything more than a No. 4 running back or kick-return specialist. ------ > D Grade - Tyreek sounds like a character from Game of Thrones.

i1uf9in,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,,"The way I look at the NBA is the most important statistic is one thing: salary. You can’t sign a bunch of super stars and expect to be good because you’ll run out of money quickly. Role players also get a ton of money so managing cap is very difficult and very important. That being said, if you obtain a certain amount of success with a team and you’ve been on that team for a significant amount of time, you get something called “bird rights” which then allows you to sign players for more money, going OVER the salary cap. This allows teams to maintain their salary under the condition that the player has already played for that team. It’s also how players gain massive contracts, such as the one Gianni’s antetokounmpo signed the previous year for a quarter of a billion dollars. Going over the salary cap has its price. If you go over it for one year, every dollar that goes over doubles. So let’s say you’re a dollar over, that dollar must be paid twice. This is called the “luxury tax” and the multipliers go up every year until it hits 4. So if a team is overpaying the salary cap by 10 million, and that’s been occurring for 4 years, the team must pay a 40 million dollar luxury tax. This is already on top of existing salaries. You must be thinking that’s impossible, no team can pay that and be profitable. That would be correct, only major market teams break even such as the lakers. That’s why having a good owner, and one that is willing to pay huge dollars to keep a team together, is so important. So tldr is that salary cap is very important and very complicated.

Tim Brown had 930 yards at age 36. TO had 983 yards and 9 TDs in his final season at age 37. Ward was battling injuries his final 2 seasons and still put up good WR2 numbers at 34. Smith was on pace for another 1,500 yard season at 36. Then he got hurt. Then he put up 800 yards in 14 games at 37. That's not bad at all lol. Fitz at 36 was the top receiver on a struggling offense. His final season was him taking the backseat to Nuk and nursing a couple injuries (first time he missed a game in 6 years). Roddy White had a very good age 33 season then took the backseat to Julio. I already mentioned Welker and Edelman being injury plagued. Welker still had a strong age 32 season and Edelman had a strong age 33 season. Both of them were significantly less healthy throughout their entire careers than Hill has been. Johnson at age 33 was similar to the first 3 years of his career and one other season in the middle. At 34 his production took a major hit as he switched teams and spent half the year catching passes from a 40 year old Matt Hasselbeck. He was done at 35 with yet another new team and no QB. Wayne at 36 was comparable to his production at 24 and 25. Harrison was an all pro at 34 and got significantly hurt at 35. Boldin had 800 yards and 4 TDs in 14 games at 35. Keyshawn was about the same or less productive at 33 and 34 than most guys I mentioned that you just complained about lol. Moss was a homer pick because he was trash after 32. Mason and Isaac Bruce also belong on the list along with some others. I just didn't list every single HoF or Hall of Very Good receiver (the truly elite WRs throughout history) in my initial list. I'm not saying anyone else is going to be Rice and be a 40 year old all pro. I just said the elite players are still productive into their mid 30s. Which every single one of those guys still had a season at or near the top of the league between ages 33 and 36 even if they had a bad year or 2 before retiring (often due to a significant injury which is more significant due to them already being at the tail end of their careers). Hill may completely destroy his leg tomorrow and be fucked, but so could Chase or Jefferson. To this point, Hill has been most healthy like a lot of the guys I listed. There's no reason to think he can't play well until 33 or 34. People exaggerate the drop off at 30 for players all the time. It's not even 30 anymore either. It's 28 (literally their prime) or 25 now for RBs. It gets more ignorant every year.",1,2022-03-24 08:08:37,tkztsx,3

I'm not saying Hill is a great boyfriend or father, but he fought long and hard to get that pregnant shit expunged (which it was), and then the abuse allegations happened, and there was pretty strong evidence to support the fact that the gf is the one that hurt the kid [(supposedly including text messages where she admitted it, but if that's the case I don't know how she didn't get arrested)]( Obviously, most people who didn't follow the entire proceedings will figure you're lying/coping/making excuses, but the facts moreso support him not being 100% guilty.

fkomki6,DeAndre Hopkins,Texans,Cardinals,SmugglersBook,"I want to quickly say that mahomes is amazing and all that but let’s also take into account that he has the perfect offensive situation maybe ever. Seriously their 4th WR would have been WR1 on the eagles last year. Wilson, prime Rodgers, prime brees, prime Brady, prime Manning could all put up similar numbers to mahomes if they had what he has. Watson himself if he continues to improve could put up similar numbers but talking about continuing to improve you could theoretically dump in a ton of players like wentz, Murray, etc. so talking “potential” is imo useless. All I’m saying is that right now Watson is closer to Wentz than he is to mahomes, that it to say that Watson is great for a YOUNG QB, but Mahomes is currently super young and playing like he’s in his prime years before his prime is supposed to be. TLDR mahomes is in a league of his own currently with Wilson being close. All the other young QB’s gotta play catch up.",7,2020-03-16 13:23:30,fjon3s,3
fkon1wg,DeAndre Hopkins,Texans,Cardinals,SmugglersBook,"Yes, the legend of mahomes is boosted by being in the perfect system for offense. At every level it is stacked. With that being said Watson could ascend to that level, but if we’re already talking hypothetical potential then who else are you also putting in that category? Wentz? Dak? Murray? Baker? Lamar? That guy said Watson could put up mahomes numbers and right now he can’t. Watson is incredibly gifted where his ceiling is comparable to mahomes but Watson is inconsistent. Look at his games this year to see, one game it’s 400 yards the next it’s 202 and 0TD. One minute he throws a beautiful ball off his back foot 20 yards down field, the play after that he’ll miss a layup of slant pass. I like Watson but honestly he’s somehow become overrated and talked about way above what his production is. Also let’s not discount his weapons they WERE great when healthy.
