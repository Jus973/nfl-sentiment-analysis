i1tkcqd,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,stormy2587,I sort of agree. I think to some extent giving up a lot of picks can be more harmful to a team long term than giving up like a single pick in the top 100. The draft is to some extent just dumb luck and finding contributors in the later rounds has been huge for some franchises. And not having those picks reduces the odds of doing that. Like Tyreek Hill was a 5th round pick. The chiefs finding an elite speed receiver in the 5th in 2016 was a huge part of them unlocking the high scoring offense starting in 2017. I don’t think this is a bad trade for miami per se just that I think number of picks in a draft matters to some extent. The Dolphins aren’t the most complete roster in the nfl and they just spent 6 picks on a single player. I think most teams would hope to net 3 contributors from those picks.

Richard Seymour was solid but he was a 30 year old and then signed pretty reasonable extensions and continued to play well (pro bowler in 2010 and 2011 and second team all pro in 2011) for the Raiders so it was a fair trade. He's literally the closest thing to a HOF defensive player you've traded. Wilfork was a stud but you just let him go in free agency at the end of his time. Kyle Van Noy you traded for so he wasn't homegrown and he just walked at the end. Willie McGinest was released. Lawyer Milloy was released. Ty Law was released. Ty Warren was released. Teddy Bruschi retired as a Patriot. Rodney Harrison retired as a Patriot. Asante Samuel walked in free agency. Malcolm Butler walked in free agency. Trey Flowers walked in free agency. Hightower is likely leaving in free agency. McCourty has been a long term patriot. Patrick Chung left for a year and came back in free agency. Literally the only guy I can remotely think of that you traded that was on defense that was remotely close to a HOF is Mike Vrabel. Chandler Jones was for a second round pick and Gilmore a sixth round pick. Those are literally the only two other guys you traded... and got no where near the haul of Hill and neither are remotely as good as Hill. Like no you didn't trade anyone on defense even remotely close to Hill's ability (let alone multiple) but keep being a homer lol.,22,2022-03-23 10:45:10,tkztsx,3,2,0,0,2.0,0.07111155241727829,0.6445252299308777,0.2843632698059082,0.21325170413416983

i1uf9in,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,,"The way I look at the NBA is the most important statistic is one thing: salary. You can’t sign a bunch of super stars and expect to be good because you’ll run out of money quickly. Role players also get a ton of money so managing cap is very difficult and very important. That being said, if you obtain a certain amount of success with a team and you’ve been on that team for a significant amount of time, you get something called “bird rights” which then allows you to sign players for more money, going OVER the salary cap. This allows teams to maintain their salary under the condition that the player has already played for that team. It’s also how players gain massive contracts, such as the one Gianni’s antetokounmpo signed the previous year for a quarter of a billion dollars. Going over the salary cap has its price. If you go over it for one year, every dollar that goes over doubles. So let’s say you’re a dollar over, that dollar must be paid twice. This is called the “luxury tax” and the multipliers go up every year until it hits 4. So if a team is overpaying the salary cap by 10 million, and that’s been occurring for 4 years, the team must pay a 40 million dollar luxury tax. This is already on top of existing salaries. You must be thinking that’s impossible, no team can pay that and be profitable. That would be correct, only major market teams break even such as the lakers. That’s why having a good owner, and one that is willing to pay huge dollars to keep a team together, is so important. So tldr is that salary cap is very important and very complicated.

He still could have been involved, despite the findings. You are clearly misinformed about the case because you're going along with the public narrative that this is some mystery where we don't know what happened. We do know what happened. Lewis was with a group of people that were attacked by another group of people outside a nightclub. Two people ended up being killed as a result of being stabbed by two of the people Lewis was with. All witnesses involved testified that Lewis was trying to break the fight up. Lewis testified and identified the two people who committed the stabbings. The courts determined (fairly quickly and easily) that this was a clear-cut case of self-defence and the two people who committed the killings were acquitted. Nobody, not the police, the lawyers involved or any of the witnesses actually thought for a second that Ray actually did any killing. He initially lied about being at the club that night and then ended up testifying, so he was charged with obstruction of justice. The lawyers and police involved with the case fully admitted that the only reason they charged Lewis with murder was to get him to testify about who actually did the killings, which is what eventually happened. >Most importantly, a verdict does not always sway the court of public opinion. This is sometimes good, and sometimes bad. Plenty of obviously bad people are found not guilty or booked on lesser charges. Our legal system has an undeniable bias toward supporting the wealthy.

i1xtd18,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,Peanut4michigan,"I said I was talking about truly elite players. Hill being one of the top receivers in the league for 5 straight years puts him in that category.

Smith was on pace for another 1,500 yard season at 36. Then he got hurt. Then he put up 800 yards in 14 games at 37. That's not bad at all lol. Fitz at 36 was the top receiver on a struggling offense. His final season was him taking the backseat to Nuk and nursing a couple injuries (first time he missed a game in 6 years). Roddy White had a very good age 33 season then took the backseat to Julio. I already mentioned Welker and Edelman being injury plagued. Welker still had a strong age 32 season and Edelman had a strong age 33 season. Both of them were significantly less healthy throughout their entire careers than Hill has been. Johnson at age 33 was similar to the first 3 years of his career and one other season in the middle. At 34 his production took a major hit as he switched teams and spent half the year catching passes from a 40 year old Matt Hasselbeck. He was done at 35 with yet another new team and no QB. Wayne at 36 was comparable to his production at 24 and 25. Harrison was an all pro at 34 and got significantly hurt at 35. Boldin had 800 yards and 4 TDs in 14 games at 35. Keyshawn was about the same or less productive at 33 and 34 than most guys I mentioned that you just complained about lol. Moss was a homer pick because he was trash after 32.

Which every single one of those guys still had a season at or near the top of the league between ages 33 and 36 even if they had a bad year or 2 before retiring (often due to a significant injury which is more significant due to them already being at the tail end of their careers). Hill may completely destroy his leg tomorrow and be fucked, but so could Chase or Jefferson. To this point, Hill has been most healthy like a lot of the guys I listed. There's no reason to think he can't play well until 33 or 34. People exaggerate the drop off at 30 for players all the time. It's not even 30 anymore either.

Seriously their 4th WR would have been WR1 on the eagles last year. Wilson, prime Rodgers, prime brees, prime Brady, prime Manning could all put up similar numbers to mahomes if they had what he has. Watson himself if he continues to improve could put up similar numbers but talking about continuing to improve you could theoretically dump in a ton of players like wentz, Murray, etc. so talking “potential” is imo useless. All I’m saying is that right now Watson is closer to Wentz than he is to mahomes, that it to say that Watson is great for a YOUNG QB, but Mahomes is currently super young and playing like he’s in his prime years before his prime is supposed to be.

That guy said Watson could put up mahomes numbers and right now he can’t. Watson is incredibly gifted where his ceiling is comparable to mahomes but Watson is inconsistent. Look at his games this year to see, one game it’s 400 yards the next it’s 202 and 0TD. One minute he throws a beautiful ball off his back foot 20 yards down field, the play after that he’ll miss a layup of slant pass.

I think BOB is just an idiot who’s convinced himself that he’s a genius and the owner is happy to let him fuck the team because it’s cheap enough and fans will still come anyways.
