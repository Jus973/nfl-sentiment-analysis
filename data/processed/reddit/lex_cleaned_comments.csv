Hill used only players after the rookie wage scale, and Johnson was made before that. So basically all you have really done is create a chart that sits between Johnson and Hill. IMO a more interesting experiment would be to combine Hill with either OTC (Fitzgerald-Spielberger) and/or Harvard charts. OTC measures value based on average second contract, Harvard measures value based on average career AV.

Their character means little to me as long as when on they are on the field they produce for my team. If they commit crimes where they need to go to jail then I hope they go to jail.

Leading receivers those games were week 1 Sammy Watkins 198 yards Week 2 Demarcus Robins 172 yards week 3 Mecole Hardman 97 yards (rookie year) week 4 Kelce with 85 yards (Mahomes threw for 315 and six guys had 30-85 yards) week 5 was the loss to Indi when Mahomes got stepped on by his offensive lineman and limped the entire game but the leading receiver was Byron Pringle with 103 yards. So my point is as long as we have Mahomes I'm not too worried about winning. He has won without Hill before and it's not like Juju and Kelce are a bad 1-2 combo. Sure Hill, Juju, Kelce was a lot more dangerous but I think we'll be fine.

i1tkcqd,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,stormy2587,I sort of agree. I think to some extent giving up a lot of picks can be more harmful to a team long term than giving up like a single pick in the top 100. The draft is to some extent just dumb luck and finding contributors in the later rounds has been huge for some franchises. And not having those picks reduces the odds of doing that. Like Tyreek Hill was a 5th round pick. The chiefs finding an elite speed receiver in the 5th in 2016 was a huge part of them unlocking the high scoring offense starting in 2017. I don’t think this is a bad trade for miami per se just that I think number of picks in a draft matters to some extent. The Dolphins aren’t the most complete roster in the nfl and they just spent 6 picks on a single player. I think most teams would hope to net 3 contributors from those picks.

He takes stress off of a guy who doesn't really react to stress and pressure well. He makes defenders focus on him and that opens options for mahomes to hit the other receivers. There is no other receiver on the roster like him and I'm not sure there is one in the draft this year either.

Hardman almost has the speed and sees a lot of the gadget plays that Hill ran in 2018/19. I could see a good ""traditional"" WR talent as allowing this team to make an aggregate approximation of Hill, so idk how much they'd be weighing burner type speed over hands and especially route running, which Hill has both in spades, but Hardman has yet to showcase. This seems like a fairly deep WR class, but I could definitely see a trade up in the cards, especially with picks 29 and 30.

Richard Seymour was solid but he was a 30 year old and then signed pretty reasonable extensions and continued to play well (pro bowler in 2010 and 2011 and second team all pro in 2011) for the Raiders so it was a fair trade. He's literally the closest thing to a HOF defensive player you've traded. Wilfork was a stud but you just let him go in free agency at the end of his time. Kyle Van Noy you traded for so he wasn't homegrown and he just walked at the end. Willie McGinest was released. Lawyer Milloy was released. Ty Law was released. Ty Warren was released. Teddy Bruschi retired as a Patriot. Rodney Harrison retired as a Patriot. Asante Samuel walked in free agency. Malcolm Butler walked in free agency. Trey Flowers walked in free agency. Hightower is likely leaving in free agency. McCourty has been a long term patriot. Patrick Chung left for a year and came back in free agency. Literally the only guy I can remotely think of that you traded that was on defense that was remotely close to a HOF is Mike Vrabel. Chandler Jones was for a second round pick and Gilmore a sixth round pick. Those are literally the only two other guys you traded... and got no where near the haul of Hill and neither are remotely as good as Hill.

i1uf9in,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,,"The way I look at the NBA is the most important statistic is one thing: salary. You can’t sign a bunch of super stars and expect to be good because you’ll run out of money quickly. Role players also get a ton of money so managing cap is very difficult and very important. That being said, if you obtain a certain amount of success with a team and you’ve been on that team for a significant amount of time, you get something called “bird rights” which then allows you to sign players for more money, going OVER the salary cap. This allows teams to maintain their salary under the condition that the player has already played for that team. It’s also how players gain massive contracts, such as the one Gianni’s antetokounmpo signed the previous year for a quarter of a billion dollars. Going over the salary cap has its price. If you go over it for one year, every dollar that goes over doubles. So let’s say you’re a dollar over, that dollar must be paid twice. This is called the “luxury tax” and the multipliers go up every year until it hits 4. So if a team is overpaying the salary cap by 10 million, and that’s been occurring for 4 years, the team must pay a 40 million dollar luxury tax. This is already on top of existing salaries. You must be thinking that’s impossible, no team can pay that and be profitable. That would be correct, only major market teams break even such as the lakers. That’s why having a good owner, and one that is willing to pay huge dollars to keep a team together, is so important. So tldr is that salary cap is very important and very complicated. It plays a huge factor in signing guys and building a good team.",3,2022-03-23 13:46:20,tkztsx,3.0,5,0,0,5.0

Steve Smith's production dramatically decreased in his final two seasons. The same is true of Larry Fitzgerald, Roddy White. Wes Welker was essentially useless during his final 2 seasons. Edelman got hurt in his final season and was utterly useless. Andre Johnson's final 3 seasons were extremely less production than any others. Reggie Wayne's final 2 seasons were dramatically worse than the rest. Marvin Harrison stunk his final 2 seasons. Boldin's final 2 seasons stunk. If your argument is that Tyreek Hill will be in the league when he's 34-36, I guess I'd agree. The idea that he's going to be decent when he's that age is a total fallacy. The better options for your case would have been Rice (who you did mention), Keyshawn, Randy Moss, maybe Derrick Mason? The list is very, very short.

Then the steelers who made it with a shit Qb got another one and I cannot bet against Tomlin, because I hate him but never had a losing season. Browns got a rapist who a lot of people have as a top 5 QB and Amari cooper. While not losing anything on their defence, Bengals obviously here as well but there is an AFCN slot so I took them out.

i1xtd18,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,Peanut4michigan,"I said I was talking about truly elite players. Hill being one of the top receivers in the league for 5 straight years puts him in that category. Tim Brown had 930 yards at age 36. TO had 983 yards and 9 TDs in his final season at age 37. Ward was battling injuries his final 2 seasons and still put up good WR2 numbers at 34. Smith was on pace for another 1,500 yard season at 36. Then he got hurt. Then he put up 800 yards in 14 games at 37. That's not bad at all lol. Fitz at 36 was the top receiver on a struggling offense. His final season was him taking the backseat to Nuk and nursing a couple injuries (first time he missed a game in 6 years). Roddy White had a very good age 33 season then took the backseat to Julio. I already mentioned Welker and Edelman being injury plagued. Welker still had a strong age 32 season and Edelman had a strong age 33 season. Both of them were significantly less healthy throughout their entire careers than Hill has been. Johnson at age 33 was similar to the first 3 years of his career and one other season in the middle. At 34 his production took a major hit as he switched teams and spent half the year catching passes from a 40 year old Matt Hasselbeck. He was done at 35 with yet another new team and no QB. Wayne at 36 was comparable to his production at 24 and 25. Harrison was an all pro at 34 and got significantly hurt at 35. Boldin had 800 yards and 4 TDs in 14 games at 35. Keyshawn was about the same or less productive at 33 and 34 than most guys I mentioned that you just complained about lol. Moss was a homer pick because he was trash after 32. Mason and Isaac Bruce also belong on the list along with some others. I just didn't list every single HoF or Hall of Very Good receiver (the truly elite WRs throughout history) in my initial list. I'm not saying anyone else is going to be Rice and be a 40 year old all pro. I just said the elite players are still productive into their mid 30s. Which every single one of those guys still had a season at or near the top of the league between ages 33 and 36 even if they had a bad year or 2 before retiring (often due to a significant injury which is more significant due to them already being at the tail end of their careers). Hill may completely destroy his leg tomorrow and be fucked, but so could Chase or Jefferson. To this point, Hill has been most healthy like a lot of the guys I listed. There's no reason to think he can't play well until 33 or 34. People exaggerate the drop off at 30 for players all the time. It's not even 30 anymore either. It's 28 (literally their prime) or 25 now for RBs. It gets more ignorant every year.",1,2022-03-24 08:08:37,tkztsx,3.0,6,0,4,10.0

fkomki6,DeAndre Hopkins,Texans,Cardinals,SmugglersBook,"I want to quickly say that mahomes is amazing and all that but let’s also take into account that he has the perfect offensive situation maybe ever. Seriously their 4th WR would have been WR1 on the eagles last year. Wilson, prime Rodgers, prime brees, prime Brady, prime Manning could all put up similar numbers to mahomes if they had what he has. Watson himself if he continues to improve could put up similar numbers but talking about continuing to improve you could theoretically dump in a ton of players like wentz, Murray, etc. so talking “potential” is imo useless. All I’m saying is that right now Watson is closer to Wentz than he is to mahomes, that it to say that Watson is great for a YOUNG QB, but Mahomes is currently super young and playing like he’s in his prime years before his prime is supposed to be. TLDR mahomes is in a league of his own currently with Wilson being close. All the other young QB’s gotta play catch up.",7,2020-03-16 13:23:30,fjon3s,3.0,2,1,0,2.5

With that being said Watson could ascend to that level, but if we’re already talking hypothetical potential then who else are you also putting in that category? Wentz? Dak? Murray? Baker? Lamar? That guy said Watson could put up mahomes numbers and right now he can’t. Watson is incredibly gifted where his ceiling is comparable to mahomes but Watson is inconsistent. Look at his games this year to see, one game it’s 400 yards the next it’s 202 and 0TD. One minute he throws a beautiful ball off his back foot 20 yards down field, the play after that he’ll miss a layup of slant pass. I like Watson but honestly he’s somehow become overrated and talked about way above what his production is. Also let’s not discount his weapons they WERE great when healthy.

When he is put in place, it’s up to Tannehill to “play heroball” and he can’t, imo Tannehill isn’t the type of quarterback that elevates his teammates which is why he wasn’t able to carry in those losses. Deshaun Watson on the other hand still played ridiculously good and wasn’t able to win on most of those statistically impressive games, so clearly he isn’t the issue with the team. What’s your point? If the Texans would’ve had a better team but Deshaun Watson underperformed, then clearly he’s one of the issues with the team but that’s not the case. I’m not saying that Tannehill is an issue, though, all I’m stating is that he isn’t as elite as people give him credit for.

Because it was innacurate (cause although he has an amazing completion percentage his adjusted accuracy rate leaves much to be desired) or b. Was his first read.

Henry is great in the 4th quarter too, but that doesn’t mean anything when the Ravens held him to only 40 yards. Let’s actually compare passing stats between Lamar & tannehill: - Lamar has a higher completion % (and that’s with crap receivers) - Lamar has a higher avg yds/att - Lamar has the record for most games with a perfect passer rating (tied with Ben) - Lamar’s led the ravens to the playoffs more times than Tannehill even though Tannehill’s already been in the NFL for a decade - Lamar has a higher avg pass yds in the postseason - Lamar led the NFL in pass TDs in 2019 Lamar’s already eclipsed Tannehill in overall talent, and he’s only been in the NFL for 3 years.

gz4rbvl,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,,"Tannehill is a really good quarterback and that’s basically where I leave it. He’s been very consistent and he’s very accurate. But it’s easier to be accurate and consistent when the run game is always a threat too. That being said, every time Henry is held to 100 yards or less and Tannehill is forced to throw more we lose. So that’s my hang up on him. Everyone in our fam base worships him because he’s the best QB we’ve had in awhile. But it’s worth noting that when mariota was benched for Tanny there were tons of other adjustments made as well, and if they were made sooner we probably wouldn’t have ever needed Tannehill. But that is an unpopular opinion within our fam base so till stop there. I love Lamar. He’s one of the best to ever do it and I doubt we will see a player like that ever again.

The chiefs games, which the ravens ended up losing obviously, he still gamed brought the ravens closer at the end of games. Not to mention the browns game like said above. He gets down and loses some games like EVERY FUCKING OTHER QB EVER. It’s the nfl it happens. He’s lost so few games and dominated so many it’s easy to focus on his losses. But the sample size is too small. Someone should check the stats but I bet even the Mannings and Bradys of the world don’t win when down more than they lose when down. It’s kind of an unfair criticism of Lamar like they say his losing when the team goes down is unique to him and other qbs do it all the time",7,2021-05-22 23:13:52,nio78u,,1,0,0,1.0

Personally I think tannehill is a good qb, prob a lil underrated, but cherry-picking stats from your own website won’t make a winning argument. Is tannehill a bad passer? Absolutely not. Are there stats where he’s better than Lamar? Sure. Are there stats where Lamar is better? Yes. Lamar’s very close to tannehill in pass ability, and that’s with very little experience and not much to work with in his receivers. As an overall Qb, Lamar is better.",2,2021-05-22 21:05:29,nio78u,,2,0,2,4.0
gz4klz3,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,PeePee_hole,"All good I already tried to respond lmao Ok I will admit me saying he adds nothing is not the right wording. He adds stability and a solid passer who is very consistent and that is an amazing thing. What I meant is he doesn’t add anything special. He doesn’t add the insane game iq of Brady, or the rocket arm of Allen or Mahomes. He doesn’t have the crazy legs of Lamar or the shiftiness of Wilson and Watson. He doesn’t have that “it” factor that an elite qb needs. When scheming against the titans a team doesn’t need to change their playstyle to adapt to him. He runs the offense exactly as vrable wants, and doesn’t make mistakes. That’s why the team started 2-4 cause mariota made a lot of mistakes. So when I say he doesn’t add anything I mean more that he doesn’t hurt the offense but he isn’t the type of guy you can build your offense around cause there’s nothing insanely special about him. Like imo his best trait is his consistency, which yes is exactly what is needed in that offense. But when I think of a qbs skill, what I’m imagining is if every qb was put on a team that is completely average but made exactly for them, who would be the best. I can’t see tanehill leading an average team to be top 5 more than I can see Brady(who has many times) Lamar(who has a below average offense and makes it elite) Allen (who is in a similar boat to lamar although he does have an amazing wr, still adds more to the offense) Mahomes, Rodgers, Wilson, and watson (who will be excellent next year. On the prison team where he belongs). I do believe he could lead that team to be top 10, but I value actual skill over production and I don’t think tanehill is a top 5 most skilled qb. I think he is 9th, 8th excluding Watson. And I’m not just talking about raw talent, I’m including mental talent and how refined and all that. Cause tbh production comes just as much from the system and players around the qb as it does from him, skill is really what separates the best from the rest",1,2021-05-22 20:44:05,nio78u,,6,3,0,9.5
gz4r47b,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,PeePee_hole,"I mean everyone looks good in New England behind Brady so that’s not saying much and keenum looked good on the box score but a deeper look at his stats and he really didnt. And I do understand what you’re saying but Allen was an mvp front runner this year. Stafford has shown what he can do and although he’ll take a step up this year, it’s not as much as Allen can do. Allen has way more potential than Stafford and Tanehill and last year showed that he has refined himself. I agree sole qbs do fall off but usually it’s cause their season is clearly a fluke when looking at it, either like Wentz where he only was good on 3rd and 4th or with the qbs you mentioned who still had glaring flaws. This off-season Allen managed to eliminate almost all of those so unless he somehow redevelops them he is top 7. And the difference is he learned and fixed it and you can see it in his mechanics while many of those other guys covered up their issues.

I also never thought he was too 5 as someone earlier in the thread said, despite his stats supporting that. I’m just glad we were able to clarify enough to go from “he doesn’t add anything to the team” to he’s “a top 10 QB”, especially considering finding a multi-year starter at QB is difficult enough, let alone finding a top 10 one. My only refute is that just because his play doesn’t jump out at you like the other guys you mentioned, doesn’t mean he doesn’t have an “it” factor. Leadership and winning can be an “it” factor. Brady was not known for his crazy game IQ for quite some time early in his career. He was known for winning at all costs. In no way am I comparing the two, just using him as an example.

You take a shitty player on a bad contract and a second round pick, we end up with cap space. That said, if something like this did become possible, I still think the original team should be responsible for the value. I’m kinda struggling putting into words, but I don’t want to see the cheap ass Bengals owner trade away half his cap so he can have tons of cheap rookies or UDFAs. Or like, if you’re trading cap space, you’re also trading some of your market share from the profits of the NFL. If you’re putting less in the pot, you should get a smaller return. Idk if any of that makes sense, but as a Saints fan, I’d love to trade for some cap space right about now.",285,2021-06-05 07:17:57,nswdv2,,2,1,2,4.5

Now imagine a situation where he can play under market value and get others to buy in that way they could trade their cap space to other teams directly for players who would help them win a Superbowl and would also be willing to play under market value. This way you don't need to give up draft picks or players, just cap space that you didn't need to use anyways. This could be abused pretty easily if players care more about winning than they do money. I think if you had a situation like this then you would need to say teams have to use up 90% of their cap each year before trading any leftover cap space away. (Right now it seems like an average of 89% spent over 4 years, so I just barely raised it and made it for each year to prevent taking players for ""nothing"").

h11pdpf,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,Kalanar,"NFL has two types of spending. Cash spending and cap spending. You can think of cap spending like monopoly money in the NFL game. At it's most basic rule you have to use 1 cap dollar for every $1 dollar you spend on a player however there are ways to delay this. The most common being a signing bonus. In that case you can pay a player $20 million in real money but instead of having to use 20 million in cap space you can use 4 million in cap space a year over 5 years. It still equals that 20 million in cap space it just delays it. If you cut or trade the player before all 5 years are up however all that cap space you still owe the NFL advances up to be due in the current year. This is what the Falcons are seeing with Julio. They owe the NFL 23,250,000 cap space(7,750,000 X 3 years). This isn't actual money being paid to Julio it's already been paid to him, the Falcons simply were delaying paying the cap space for it. Since he was traded the NFL wants all that cap space now. However another rule the NFL has is if the cut/trade takes place after June 1st you don't have to pay it all back this year it can be spread out over two years. Which is why the Falcons were waiting to trade him. In that case the 7,750,000 in cap space they owe the NFL this year stays the same but the final two years(15,500,000) advance to hit their cap next year. It still totals the 23,250,000 in total cap space they owe the NFL.",5,2021-06-08 09:44:57,nv6gbo,,0,0,0,2.0

i6mvzpi,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,KingTwist0314,"Honestly, the Eagles had a great first day of the draft. Jordan Davis was the best DT in the draft imo and he will be great for Philly, I think he was worth the trade up because I'm sure the Ravens would've picked him if he was there. I do think they could've stayed where they were and pick up Kyle Hamilton but this was a fine move regardless. Basically trading their second 1st round pick for AJ Brown was a fantastic move considering Brown is likely better right now than any other WR in this draft will be in the future. Giving up a 1st and then having to pay him 25 million is a steep price to pay but I do think it was worth it because imo Brown is a top 10 WR in the league and should immediately come in and make the Eagles better from the jump. The Eagles are inarguably better now and I'm certainly not excited about seeing Brown twice a year lol.",42,2022-04-28 23:18:20,ueb3m7,,2,1,0,6.5

Garrett Wilson, Drake London, Jameson Williams, Treylon Burks, Chris Olave, Jahan Dotson and George Pickens are all players who I think have All Pro caliber potential and will be playing as well as or better than any other WR in the league at some point over the next few years.

Justyn Ross, Khalil Shakir, John Metchie, Christian Watson, David Bell, Jalen Tolbert, Alec Pierce, Romeo Doubs, Wan'Dale Robinson, Skyy Moore and Jaivon Heiligh are all players I think have Pro Bowl level potential and will be solid players for their respective teams for several years.

i6nt8rd,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,JackFisherBooks,"True, but a better QB is the overriding factor there. That said, Philly has shown in the past that they know how to surround their QBs with capable talent and a good system. Nick Foles might not have been on the same level as most top tier QBs, but he had a very capable cast of receivers and tight ends around him. And he, along with Wentz before he got hurt, was able to carry that team to the playoffs. Philly just hasn't had that cast of talent in a while. But AJ Brown will definitely help. I still believe Jalen Hurts can elevate his game enough to compete with teams like Dallas. But I still think they're a few pieces away. I'm also not confident Dallas can pick up where they left off. Every time Dallas has a winning season, they follow it up by losing key players and regressing badly.

I bring this up because everyone wasnt quick to turn on wentz because of his draft profile. In reality you need to just give young qbs time and surrounded them with actual talent. In 2016 we had garbage defense, good line, and no wrs. Wentz and the team looked competent but still struggled. We literally saw the same thing happen this year.

i6nvwmf,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,moesus81,"That’s fair and Dak is significantly better than Hurts right now (and Wentz obviously, since I mentioned Washington) The SB team was just magical and everything just fell into place that year. The defense held ATL to 10 and MIN to 7. It’s hard to lose games in that situation, even though they were real close to losing the ATL game. Luckily Foles was able to step up in the SB when Brady was just absolutely shredding us for 500 yards. Ertz was our leading pass catcher that year, the top 2 WR (Algholor and Jeffery) didn’t have huge years. They had 119 catches for 1,557 yards and 17 TD combined. AJ Brown is a significant upgrade over both of those guys. Philly’s OL and DL is better than Dallas as well but QB is just too important in this era. Hopefully Hurts can improve with a much better cast around him. I like Schultz a lot but who is going to be the #2 WR while Gallup is out? ACL isn’t a huge deal anymore but it might take him a while to play at the same level as well. I’m also not too confident in Dallas this year but the NFL is so unpredictable, so we’ll see. If Washington’s D is like it was 2 years ago and Wentz doesn’t completely choke when it matters, they will be a problem as well. NFC East is open for the taking aside from NYG.

i6nyeu4,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,JackFisherBooks,"I agree. That Super Bowl run by Philly was truly magical. That team just had everything clicking in all the right ways. That's not something you can repeat. Foles just got hot at the right time. And to date, I've never seen Hurts get hot in the same way. But Hurts has never had someone like AJ Brown to throw to. And if the defense steps up, he might not have to win so many games on his own. I think that's key because, unless you're Tom Brady, you just can't win ball games like that. I'm also not at all confident that Washington will make it work with Wentz. In fact, I suspect that team will completely collapse halfway through the season and will be in the running for the number one overall pick. Their defense just fell apart last year. Plus, Wentz just can't stay healthy. I saw this happen last year with Fitzpatrick. Washington was hyping him up all offseason, hoping he could win with a dominant defense. Then, the defense regressed and Fitz got hurt in the first quarter of the first game. That doesn't bode well for Wentz. I honestly don't see him starting all 16 games in this season or any season at this point. The NFC East will be competitive, but I think it'll be between Dallas and Philly. I also think the Giants might take a step forward. I think Daniel Jones is no world-beater, but he hasn't had a lot of weapons to work with, let alone a defense.

i6o9tlm,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,JackFisherBooks,"Good points. I do believe there is such a thing as being too tough for your own good, so much so that you start to hurt your team. We saw that last year with Big Ben. I really believe Pittsburgh hurt themselves by sticking with him for as long as they did. I admired his toughness too, but those injuries clearly took a toll on him. And it severely affected his play. The problem was that they just didn't have a capable backup. And in a division with Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson, that's just not going to cut it. And honestly, as skeptical as I am, I would love to see Wentz succeed in Washington. I haven't forgotten how dominant he was for the first part of that 2017 season with the Eagles. He was a legit MVP candidate before he got hurt. And while he's not as old as Big Ben, I do think the amount of injuries he has sustained is just too much. On top of that, just look at what happens to players who go to Washington these days. Both Alex Smith and Ryan Fitzpatrick suffered serious injuries in their first season. For Fitz, it might have been career ending. There's just something wrong with Washington. Every player that goes there only ever thrives briefly before suffering severe setbacks. It's been that way since Dan Snyder bought the team. And at the rate its going, I won't be surprised if that team eventually moves, since nobody wants to give them a new stadium. They're just too consistently bad and the fanbase has just eroded over the years. I've been to that stadium. It's basically a home game for Philly and Washington at this point. But, if Wentz can buck that trend, more power to him. That should earn him MVP consideration by default. But history is working against him. I also believe that the Giants' franchise quarterback isn't on the roster. Jones has shown potential, but he regressed way too much last year and he can no longer stay healthy. I wouldn't be surprised if the Giants took a flyer on a QB in the 2nd or 3rd round tonight. And if they do, I'd be willing to bet money that that QB will be starting games by the end of the season. It may ultimately come down to injury. One thing that I think people overlooked with Dallas last year was how lucky they got with injuries, until the playoffs. It seems Dallas always has such a top-heavy team, which is why they're often on the brink of salary cap hell. Just a few injuries is all it takes to utterly derail their season. Last year, it didn't happen. This year, I think they're gambling it won't happen again and that could backfire horribly. The Eagles might not have the same glut of talent as the Cowboys at the moment. But in terms of depth, I think they have the advantage.",1,2022-04-29 08:04:21,ueb3m7,,3,0,1,6.0

But on a more serious note, this gives a ton of flexibility of what to do in the draft now. We could either go BPA with our first pick and go depth with WR later. It also allows us to not have to focus as heavily on a deep threat player like Olave or Williams in favor of a bigger body like London or Wilson.

Thus, the cowboys did not overpay for Dak Prescott because it is the QB market that led to him making 40m/yr. This is that person’s argument broken down in, honestly, the simplest way I possibly can. Saying the QB market is why Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is revisionist history. The reason Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is because of the cowboys front office not properly handling this situation. I explained where they misstepped and how those missteps resulted in Dak having the organization by the balls. As a result, the cowboys placed themselves in a position where they paid Dak Prescott 40m/yr. The cowboys did not pay Dak Prescott 40m/yr because of the QB market.

It is revisionist history because the person making this claim is not giving the actual reason why Dak Prescott was paid 40m/yr.

Thus, the cowboys did not overpay for Dak Prescott because it is the QB market that led to him making 40m/yr. That's not their argument. The first person said: ""Dallas overpaid Dak (and Zeke but we're ignoring that part). Now they have to get rid of pieces to afford him"" OP said: ""Dak isn't overpaid that's just the price of a QB now. His contract is not hurting the team."" That's a value assessment based on right now. It's independent of what he could have been had for in the past which is what you're discussing. He's arguing ""if"" Dak is overpaid you're arguing ""why"" Dak is overpaid. > Saying the QB market is why Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is revisionist history. The reason Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is because of the cowboys front office not properly handling this situation. I explained where they misstepped and how those missteps resulted in Dak having the organization by the balls. As a result, the cowboys placed themselves in a position where they paid Dak Prescott 40m/yr. The cowboys did not pay Dak Prescott 40m/yr because of the QB market. So, saying that the QB market is why Dak Prescott is paid 40m/yr is revisionist history. More than one thing can be a factor, they misplayed the negotiations which drug it out and when they finally made a deal ""market"" value had changed. You're painting the two things as mutually exclusive to make yourself right when it's not mutually exclusive. >It is revisionist history because the person making this claim is not giving the actual reason why Dak Prescott was paid 40m/yr. He is revising history and saying that Dak got paid because of the QB market when in reality he got paid because of the cowboys mishandling the entire process. You're adding context and it doesn't contradict what anyone is saying. Neither of you are wrong, he's not revising history. Dak's contract amount is literally a product of the QB market. Dallas' misplayed the QB market and cost themselves money. That doesn't mean he's overpaid if he's producing inline with his contract amount, regardless of if they could have had him for less. >If this doesn’t clear it up, I don’t know what will.

Cooper fits that bill reasonably, and by trading for his contract before the WR market blew up, they are in a better spot than they would be just trying to pick up an unrestricted FA WR to be that guy now, if there are any left, or hoping to draft one after losing so many picks.

Hill used only players after the rookie wage scale, and Johnson was made before that. So basically all you have really done is create a chart that sits between Johnson and Hill. IMO a more interesting experiment would be to combine Hill with either OTC (Fitzgerald-Spielberger) and/or Harvard charts. OTC measures value based on average second contract, Harvard measures value based on average career AV.

Lied about being able to return from an Achilles injury, just so he could stay in the spotlight. 2. Skipped mandatory minicamp for a trip to Egypt, then called out his coach for saying it was unexcused. 3. Demanded the team sign his buddies (Hackett, Cobb, Boyle), but took no responsibility once they did. 4. Either got his coach fired or, at best, failed to step in and defend him after he threw a pick that lost them a game. 5. Publicly blamed a teammate for running the wrong route when he didn’t even have to make that throw—and could’ve taken a checkdown for a first down. Aaron Rodgers is a terrible leader. It shouldn’t be considered taboo or “hating” to say that. Sure, the guys you listed are worse, but I never claimed Aaron’s the worst leader ever.

Supposedly he lost a lot of support in the locker room when he was filming his series for Netflix. The team thought he was over dramatic and putting himself over winning games. Him and his family ripping into to Jimmy G was looked at as snake like, as bad as Jimmy was at playing the game he’s always been beloved in the locker room. Our coach said all healthy players will play a series in the preseason. Davante came out the next day and said he never plays in the preseason and shouldn’t have to. The day after he had a “hamstring injury” during a walk thru and didn’t play in the preseason game. Just a lot of typical WR diva shit that was pissing everyone off but he wasn’t as vocal about it as Diggs and maintained a good image with all his public appearances. Which didn’t help some on our team from thinking he was selfish and two faced. Also another major thing. He was gone from camp for 2 weeks for the birth of his child. Now I’ll absolutely admit family comes before everything. But we were in the middle of installing a brand new offense and having a QB battle to see who would be leading the team. Having your star WR1 absent for that long in that critical moment was also not looked at as a player being bought in. For reference our backup up safety that just got bumped to the starting role missed exactly 1 day for the birth of his kid and the average around the league is 2 days… not weeks. In a different state in the middle of training camp.

Davante Adams is 32 years old and comes with a hefty price tag, the remainder of which the Jets volunteered to pay 100%. Rodgers already has one foot in the door of the old folks home, and is one embarrassing performance coupled with any semblance of an injury away from hanging it up. They just fired their head coach, demoted their OC. They traded for an elite pass rusher who they can’t/won’t sign. The defense, outside of Sauce, can’t stop anyone. With an eye on the future, beyond the salary cap allocation now tied up by Adams, they gave up a 3rd round pick which may become a 2nd. This move makes sense if they’re 4-2, maybe.

Both are passionate guys but we've seen Pierce struggle with strategic decisions at key points in the game (see the Chargers game this year and several games last year). I think the league doesn't see him as head coach material either otherwise a team would've given him a shot already. I also felt both Rich and Pierce looked better than they were because of Covid and injuries down the stretch. For Rich it was mainly Covid taking out key players from the other team and last year in 6 of the 9 games Pierce was head coach we played back up QBs some of whom had never played a regular season minute. I think we had to hire Pierce after what happened with Rich and our best players (Crosby and Adams) came out in support of Pierce. I think Rich might have been better than Pierce because we had Bradley as DC (and with his HC experience maybe he could've helped him a little) and Mayock drafted well his last year here. He would've had to find a good OC, it wasn't Olson, Gruden was the one calling the offensive plays. I 100% agree that Carr hasn't been the same since breaking his leg and I felt we should've started a rebuild earlier. We still haven't drafted a QB in the 1st or 2nd since we took Carr.

IMO a more interesting experiment would be to combine Hill with either OTC (Fitzgerald-Spielberger) and/or Harvard charts.

If you add both sixteenth picks together (admittedly owned by different teams at the moment) in the 2nd and 4th you get 146. So your deal is arguably *worse* than what I proposed.

The good: he gets yards every year with volume, he's durable af, he doesn't fumble, he's a lockeroom leader despite the off field stuff, he has a knack for being good in big situations. The bad: Joe is slow, and goes down easy. He can't block at all.",7,2024-03-12 10:12:44,1bczvzw,,2,0,2,4.0
kulodur,Joe Mixon,Bengals,Texans,sculltt,"Bengals were still getting light boxes to run against even without Burrow. Mixon averaged like 4 yards before contact, and ended up at 4 YPC. His best rate stat was yards per reception, where he was 15th out of 34 qualified RBs, so basically average. Oh, he also still can't pass block. Now, I think he can still be ok in a more limited role, but it would be a huge mistake to think he can be any kind of bellcow type.",1,2024-03-12 16:56:03,1bczvzw,,1,1,0,3.5

The other options if it's not a 7th: * HOU 126 (4th) straight up - Amazing for y'all, highway robbery for us. * HOU 126 (4th) for CIN 148 (5th) - Great for y'all, bad for us. * 2025 5th - Great for y'all, bad for us. I'd be fine with a 4th-for-5th swap if y'all are eating the bonus.

He did trade Carson Palmer, but only after the Raiders gave up a 1st and 2nd for him. > He’s not gonna lose out on much if any money. In what world is $20 million not much money? We've already seen the team play with just JChase and the Bengals were fine. It isn't like they will be desperate. Maybe MAYBE if their are injuries or losses but honestly, he hasn't even said he'll hold out. I very much doubt he will in part because he knows the Bengals hold all the cards. That isn't to say a new deal won't happen or that Tee can't pressure him, but the idea that Tee is going to hold out while on the franchise tag is extremely far fetched.",1,2024-03-13 16:28:11,1bczvzw,,0,3,0,3.5
