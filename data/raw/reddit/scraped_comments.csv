I was at a game this year with a bud and we said “let’s watch Jeudy’s route this play.” He gave up after like 5 steps, started jogging, Russ threw it to where he should be and threw an interception (Commander’s game early in season). He consistently did shit like that, more often than he caught the ball smh.

Edit: I see all the downvotes, but I’ve never been more correct about anything. Jeudy would sabotage plays with his lazy route running more often than he would try.",-28,2024-03-09 09:53:16

personally, before this season, taking his college play and rookie NFL year only, into consideration, I thought Jeudy was the best route runner and the sleeper stud WR being undervalued and I absolutely wanted him for the chefs.



More so now, after seeing that interaction with Steve Smith, and added to that, Steve Smith’s absolute filleting of the JAG in conjunction with his performance and attitude, I could not be happier than him going to the Cleve to get his shit figured out.

The man needs mentoring from Jarvis Landry and Cooper, but from everything we’ve seen so far, JJ solely manufactures and delivers his “own brand” of “success” and “doesn’t need” jaws flapping in his ear.

JJ has nowhere to go but up.  Like he is Dwayne Bowe with less respectability (and I’m still mad about that draft pick that long ago).

There are also the Harvard, Chase Stuart, and Fitzgerald-Spielberger charts and they're really all over the place. Then of course the teams are almost certainly working off their own proprietary values.

Jimmy Johnson: 3-95


Rich Hill: 4-111


Chase Stuart: 5-147


Harvard: 7-218

Hill and Johnson both used the same method for calculating values: historical trades. The difference is pretty much only the data used. Hill used only players after the rookie wage scale, and Johnson was made before that. So basically all you have really done is create a chart that sits between Johnson and Hill.

IMO a more interesting experiment would be to combine Hill with either OTC (Fitzgerald-Spielberger) and/or Harvard charts. OTC measures value based on average second contract, Harvard measures value based on average career AV. In that sense, you'd be getting an average between what teams have historically traded those picks for (Hill) and what a players' actual return is, which is sorry of the reason these charts exist anyway.",1,2024-03-18 04:52:08

1bh03gs,Jerry Jeudy from Broncos to Browns,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,kvc3y4q,practicalist,"First, thank you for reading the article and contributing.  There are arguments for all the charts, but I think you can see why the JJ & RH charts worked best for this exercise.  Also, all the values in the combined chart are the result of the values in the JJ & RH charts. I added nothing to them, thus the combined chart is also their values and not mine.

I think you make an excellent point about the middle rounds being devalued in the two charts I used compared to the other charts.  There could be some tweaking that could be done to the JJ/RH and the combined chart that looks into that underrepresentation.

And while I may agree with your examples of the 76th pick not being worth the 101 & 102 picks, or the 200 pick being worth picks 240 thru 246(the first example I am not so sure couldn't or hasn't happened).

But neither example you cited is nearly as horrendous as the one you omitted that came from the article:

1bh03gs,Jerry Jeudy from Broncos to Browns,Jerry Jeudy,Broncos,Browns,kvbqy9a,practicalist,"IMO, 3 stand out.

The Fields trade netted below what it could have.  However I do think the decision to trade him was correct as he was a sunk cost.  The Bears couldn't pick up the option or sign him to an extension without seeing him play.

Poles misread the market.  I think he was holding out for at least a 2nd round pick like the Darnold trade(a 6th + future 2nd + future 4th if I remember right).  Then all the QB needy teams acquired bridge QBs for very little draft captital.  Poles was then faced with a priced market that was also now berift of buyers.

I have no proof, but I would not be surprised if we find out a team(s) offered the Bears a 4th round pick for Fields and the Bears turned it down early in the market.  

Carolina also mismanaged Burns and ended up having no leverage in the trade market.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that Carolina lost far more potential draft capital by holding on to Burns for 2023, than the Bears lost by holding onto Fields too long in the FA period.

It will make sense to you eventually. Why is Lamar still unsigned? No owner is going to guarantee every last dollar to the player. Haslem wanted to make a splash and he pulled out the checkbook for Watson to make it happen and it was unprecedented. And now every other owner has said between themselves never again for the standard it’ll set moving forward. 

Why is Rodgers not going to retire/can get traded? Because he’s due $50 million this year in real cash dollars, his cap hit is $40 million. No matter what happens Rodgers will get his $50 million paid to him but the cap hit will be adjusted to make it work with New York. Gee how come?

The 49ers played in 2 NFC Championships 2019-2021 or better. Granted, we did not win it all. *Granted.* But seriously, what have the Dolphins done for anyone since 1999 (the end of the ERA)? And guess what, you had to hire your new coach from our coaching staff. You've also acquired (facile origins, i.e. McDaniel has brought coaches and players in FA to the Dolphins) a few of our players, now former players.

We have built really well through the draft and in the middle rounds, been judicious and smart in our trades and gotten abundant fruit from our trades/FA/UDFA and other talent acquisition.

tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1tt921,Slugggo,"I'm off the internet for a few hours and WHAT THE HELL? Where did this come from? 

A look at the current Dolphins receivers: 

 - Tyreek Hill
 - Jaylen Waddle
 - DeVante Parker (signed through 2023) 
 - Cedric Wilson (just signed 3y FA deal from the Cowboys) 
 - Preston Williams (just signed small 1y FA deal) 
 - TE Mike Gesicki (just got franchise tagged for 2022)

(that's not counting other guys like Albert Wilson, Lynn Bowden, and the unstoppable Isaiah Ford, who will somehow find his way back off the practice squad to catching passes for Miami in November) 

Do the Dolphins try to deal DVP? He's been injury prone, maybe you keep him around to be loaded or in case someone else gets hurt?

Lotta KC fans in the Chiefs subreddit don't seem to understand that decisions like this were coming as soon as Mahomes signed that contract. Sucks but that's a lot of capital to work with and the position doesn't matter. KC has the 29th and 30th pick this year now along with 10 other picks this year. This is what you have to do to pay a generational QB the money a generational QB should make while remaining competitive. Drafts aren't sure things obviously but any WR coming to KC has a chance to be great with Mahomes, that's the benefit you get from paying the money for Mahomes. Just gotta ride it out and see.

1. A player's value to your team is measured by their production on their field, relative to the amount of cap money you pay them.
2. When you pay a player the highest (by far) at their position, it is not very likely that you are going to have an enormously positive valued contract. There's a good chance you will end up with a negatively valued contract.
3. Giving away 5 picks + undertaking a slightly positive (AT BEST) value contract = profit????

I could see giving the picks if he didn't get a new contract with it, and I could see giving the contract without giving any or many picks. But this just seems like throwing away resources by the dolphins.",3,2022-03-23 11:46:02

As long as a player is not going to jail I can easily overlook his off the field issues because I care about a team and want to see my team win. I’m not friends with any of these players. Their character means little to me as long as when on they are on the field they produce for my team. If they commit crimes where they need to go to jail then I hope they go to jail. But if they are able to avoid jail and remain an active player in the NFL then who am I to have some moral high ground and say they shouldn’t be in the league? They are going to be on somebody’s team and if they are really good then I want them on mine.

Here's an idea, Miami.  Why don't you do some serious scouting and find a wide receiver in the draft....like Kansas City did in the fifth round 6 years ago.

Wide receiver is, by a huge margin, the most overrated, overpaid position in football.   And now the Dolphins are paying the most ever on that position.

Cleveland just picked up Amari Cooper for a FIFTH round pick.   The Dolphins give up half a draft class on this abusive idiot.

I just get a kick out of it. A good metaphor is recycling. Corporations spend millions and billions of dollars convincing you that YOU are the problem. If only you recycled your paper towel rolls and sorted all your cans. Then all of the problems with the environment would be fixed. Ignore the giant smoke-pouring factory directly behind us.

The NFL spends millions and billions of dollars on PR, to dress up the fact that a huge portion of players are not choir boys. Which should surprise no one. It’s the most violent sport ever played. It is literally a metaphor for war. It’s no wonder that it attracts some not-so-wholesome characters at the highest level. The onus isn’t on the fans to pick and choose by some purity test.

tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1tdgen,None,"I feel like both sides lose.

They just lost a lot, and while Juju is a good player his role is very very different than Hill and he needs to be an after thought for the defense. They gonna come out and start running now? I don’t know what they envision. Probably the best of a bad situation for them I suppose.

The Dolphins give up a lot to bring in a 28 year old speed guy, who they are going to make the highest paid ever at his position, while having question marks in a ton of spots… and now it’s going to be harder to move in from Tua with less capital, which looks to be the most likely scenario based on what we’ve seen so far.

Maybe Im wrong and there is actually a lot of talent on this roster that I missed, but their O-line was horrible, their run game was non-existent, and their defense was average at best (mostly due to a 5-game stretch in which they played some awful opponents).

Just not a cannon arm, deep ball on the run off the back foot or anything - but he has a very accurate deep ball from the pocket. And obviously you’re being facetious but yes he can throw the ball 60 yards lol

Was hard to evaluate him last season because the line was historically bad and his only really solid receiver was Waddle. Plays almost never developed long enough for deep routes like that. But in theory with the rebuilt line and more WRs who can get separation, could be great for Tua",1,2022-03-23 11:10:49
tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1u51ja,paperbackgarbage,"> but Tua might not have the arm talent and the draft is a crap shoot.

Thankfully for Tua, Miami scheme isn't going to be based around him trying to dime Tyreek and Waddle at at all times.  Assuming that McDaniel still has a boner for that [21 personnel,](https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2019/06/49ers-21-1.png?resize=1024,551) the WRs aren't going to be the focal point of the offense---rather, it'll be Mostert/Edmonds/Gaskin. 

> KC nails the draft picks and utilizes the cap space, 

There's TONS of twitchy, sure-handed WRs in this year's draft.  While the draft ***is*** a crapshoot...having Mahomes as your QB will always elevate a reserve into a starter, or a starter into a superstar.

Also, Kelce isn't getting any younger, so re-signing a 30 year old Tyreek just didn't make sense for their long-term goals.  

Finally, you really have to give KC credit.  They basically shored up 40% of their OL during the last draft alone.",2,2022-03-23 12:41:19
tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1ua8u7,None,"> This trade makes a SB less likely for KC this year

tbf we went without him in 2019 for basically the first 5 weeks because he got injured at the very start of the Jacksonville game.... we went 4-1 and scored 30+ three of those games.

Leading receivers those games were

week 1 Sammy Watkins 198 yards

Week 2 Demarcus Robins 172 yards

week 3 Mecole Hardman 97 yards (rookie year)

week 4 Kelce with 85 yards (Mahomes threw for 315 and six guys had 30-85 yards)

week 5 was the loss to Indi when Mahomes got stepped on by his offensive lineman and limped the entire game but the leading receiver was Byron Pringle with 103 yards.

So my point is as long as we have Mahomes I'm not too worried about winning. He has won without Hill before and it's not like Juju and Kelce are a bad 1-2 combo. Sure Hill, Juju, Kelce was a lot more dangerous but I think we'll be fine. I didn't expect the move the team made today but I'm not upset about it and I think it'll be good in the long run.",2,2022-03-23 13:14:09

tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1tkcqd,stormy2587,"I sort of agree. I think to some extent giving up a lot of picks can be more harmful to a team long term than giving up like a single pick in the top 100. The draft is to some extent just dumb luck and finding contributors in the later rounds has been huge for some franchises. And not having those picks reduces the odds of doing that. 

Like Tyreek Hill was a 5th round pick. The chiefs finding an elite speed receiver in the 5th in 2016 was a huge part of them unlocking the high scoring offense starting in 2017. 

I don’t think this is a bad trade for miami per se just that I think number of picks in a draft matters to some extent. 

The Dolphins aren’t the most complete roster in the nfl and they just spent 6 picks on a single player. I think most teams would hope to net 3 contributors from those picks. With 2 that you would hope could be starters.",1,2022-03-23 10:30:20

tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1tllfp,shapu,"Hyperbole at worst. 

But I'll explain. Mahomes constantly seeks home runs. He's a big play guy. And Hill makes that kind of play possible. He can transform simple underneath routes into huge gains thanks to his speed and escapability, and of course he can get the deep ball too. He takes stress off of a guy who doesn't really react to stress and pressure well. He makes defenders focus on him and that opens options for mahomes to hit the other receivers.

There is no other receiver on the roster like him and I'm not sure there is one in the draft this year either. Mahomes does not have another weapon who can help him make big plays on both short and long balls.

Now, the chiefs will still be good without Hill. Their division basically guarantees that. But unless they can find another like him, they won't win another ring.",0,2022-03-23 10:38:04

So it was basically either be nice to Davante and trade him to the team he wants to go to for a little less or drag it out for months and months and not be able to move on with the cap and possibly lose guys like Rasul Douglass just because you were trying to get 2 firsts instead of a first and a 2nd.

Kelce is amazing, but he's also a TE, slower, and not a deep threat, so you're not keeping a safety deep over the middle for him. You can chuck LB's, safety's, have DE's hold him up at the line.  it's a bit different and you have more options than with the fastest WR in the league outside.

Juju hasn't really done much since 2018.  his 2020 was 800yards, but 8.4y/r.  Nothing in there says he's a #1 receiver in any way. Hoping/guessing they have a plan to get a real #1, or move up and draft a fast playmaker.",3,2022-03-23 12:19:09
tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1u0bbn,TeffyWeffy,"look, I'm a chiefs fan, I hope it works out.  Maybe they trade some picks to move up and get a better 1st round spot, maybe they pick up or trade for a FA WR #1.

Right now they've got one of the worst receiver corps in the league, JuJu's stats fell off a cliff after brown left, and hardman/robinson aren't even a good 3/4 option.  Aging Kelce gonna get doubled nonstop.

unless they make more moves, this was basically just a get whatever you can cause you can't afford someone.  The best skill player on offense at wr/rb/te is turning 33 next year, the next best hasn't had a great season since 2018, everyone after that isn't even starter level quality.",8,2022-03-23 12:11:06
tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1u3lj8,TeffyWeffy,"yea. I mean, if you can't pay him, and you're bloated from paying mahomes a billion dollars, and keeping frank clark for some reason, then getting draft picks you can put on cheap contracts and pray some are useful is your best option.

Tyreek (28) is a year younger than Davante, has 2 less NFL seasons of wear on his body, I feel they could have gotten a little more as it's basically two 2nd round picks and 3 lotto tickets.  Think a team trying for a SB might give two 1sts, or a 1st and two 2nds, etc.

they'll have to use the 1st rounder to replace him (possibly use a few to trade up), so they traded a top 5 WR for an unproven rookie, the 50th pick, 3 lotto tickets, and cap space.  Dunno, will see in a year or two if it works out I guess.",1,2022-03-23 12:32:05

I'm not 100% sure what the discount number is for future picks but even ignoring the discount, two low fourths, and a 6th wouldn't be enough to move from 29th to 22nd. Now if you factor in the difference between the 50th and 53rd pick it get fairly close. I'd guess the values end up being nearly identical which then leaves room for opinions on whether you value quantity over quality. 

The two 4ths and the sixth is about the same value as 1 comp pick at the very end of the 3rd round. A quality team would rather have the third and quantity team would take the 3 picks. The packers roster is pretty stacked so I prefer quality especially since two of the picks are next year and presumably Rodgers won't be around for those low picks to develop, if they even pan out.",3,2022-03-23 10:53:38

Between latitude 25.7, where I was born, and 41.7, where I live now, there are 16 degrees of Earth's surface.

To the extent that Tua's rep as a 2-yard thrower is based on reality and not just hate, I think it's because 1) the line is so shit that he has no choice / short passes were used instead of runs; 2) his injury affected his ability to throw deep (which looked less of a concern last year and hopefully continues to be less this year); 3) possibly his confidence was shaken, but this is just a guess",1,2022-03-23 12:21:33

> In a police investigation, Stallworth admitted to drinking the night before the accident. News sources reported that his blood alcohol content was 0.12, over the legal limit of 0.08.[27][28]

> On April 1, 2009, Stallworth was charged with DUI manslaughter; he surrendered to police on April 2, 2009, and was released on $200,000 bail.[29] Under a plea deal, he received a sentence of 30 days in the county jail, plus 1,000 hours of community service, two years of community control, and eight years' probation.[30] His Florida state driver's license was permanently suspended.[31] On July 10, 2009, Stallworth was released from county jail after serving 24 days of a 30-day sentence.

> The Associated Press reported on June 16, 2009, that Stallworth and the Reyes family reached a financial agreement, avoiding a civil lawsuit. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed.[32]

> On August 13, 2009, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Stallworth would be suspended for the 2009 season without pay. Stallworth was reinstated after Super Bowl XLIV.[33]

Richard Seymour was solid but he was a 30 year old and then signed pretty reasonable extensions and continued to play well (pro bowler in 2010 and 2011 and second team all pro in 2011) for the Raiders so it was a fair trade. He's literally the closest thing to a HOF defensive player you've traded. 

Wilfork was a stud but you just let him go in free agency at the end of his time. 

Kyle Van Noy you traded for so he wasn't homegrown and he just walked at the end. 

Willie McGinest was released. 

Lawyer Milloy was released.

Ty Law was released.

Ty Warren was released.

Teddy Bruschi retired as a Patriot. 

Rodney Harrison retired as a Patriot.

Asante Samuel walked in free agency.

Malcolm Butler walked in free agency. 

Trey Flowers walked in free agency. 

Hightower is likely leaving in free agency. 

McCourty has been a long term patriot. 

Patrick Chung left for a year and came back in free agency. 

Literally the only guy I can remotely think of that you traded that was on defense that was remotely close to a HOF is Mike Vrabel. 

Chandler Jones was for a second round pick and Gilmore a sixth round pick. Those are literally the only two other guys you traded... and got no where near the haul of Hill and neither are remotely as good as Hill.

Are the Bills a super evaluator of QB talent just because they hit Josh Allen? Yeah let's just move him and we can find another Josh next year lol. Or the Patriots hit on Tom Brady in Rd 6 in 2000 so they should just grab another GOAT QB late.

Seriously google draft grades instant reactions from 2016, they are full of people confused about the pick completely saying he was a terrible pick at 5th round without even mentioning off-the-field issues.  



Sports illustrated didn't even make a note of his pick.  PFF didn't mention him in their analysis either other than listing him there as a running back.  

Bleacher Report said this:

>How he'll fit on the Chiefs roster remains to be seen...  It seems it will be tough for Hill to crack the roster as anything more than a No. 4 running back or kick-return specialist.

Tyreek sounds like a character from Game of Thrones. Tyreek Lannister, perhaps? That's the best analysis I have for Tyreek Hill, as he wasn't in my top 400. He was kicked off Oklahoma State's team for domestic violence.  https://walterfootball.com/nfldraftgrades2016_5.php

Mentioned as a Devin Hester comparison - as in don't expect him to be a WR he's here to return kicks only.

Chiefs fan blog Arrowhead Pride just wrote how the Chiefs aren't sure if they will try him at WR or RB.

Yes.

But tons of high caliber players play well into their mid 30s at every position. Those guys are in their own tier for a reason.

Except for that one game where we put Osemele in at Guard and CEH went for 166/6.2 but then Osemele promptly got injured the next game?

In his only other season (last season), Chiefs fans gave up on him because he fumbled twice early in the season (one sealed a loss). Then they forgot about him because he got injured.

He definitely has not had a make or break year yet. But I wouldn't be surprised if the Chiefs draft his backup with the quiet thought that hopefully the guy they draft exceeds expectations and becomes the starter.",4,2022-03-23 13:29:12

tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1uf9in,None,"The way I look at the NBA is the most important statistic is one thing: salary. You can’t sign a bunch of super stars and expect to be good because you’ll run out of money quickly. Role players also get a ton of money so managing cap is very difficult and very important.

That being said, if you obtain a certain amount of success with a team and you’ve been on that team for a significant amount of time, you get something called “bird rights” which then allows you to sign players for more money, going OVER the salary cap. This allows teams to maintain their salary under the condition that the player has already played for that team. It’s also how players gain massive contracts, such as the one Gianni’s antetokounmpo signed the previous year for a quarter of a billion dollars. 

Going over the salary cap has its price. If you go over it for one year, every dollar that goes over doubles. So let’s say you’re a dollar over, that dollar must be paid twice. This is called the “luxury tax” and the multipliers go up every year until it hits 4. So if a team is overpaying the salary cap by 10 million, and that’s been occurring for 4 years, the team must pay a 40 million dollar luxury tax. This is already on top of existing salaries.

You must be thinking that’s impossible, no team can pay that and be profitable. That would be correct, only major market teams break even such as the lakers. That’s why having a good owner, and one that is willing to pay huge dollars to keep a team together, is so important.

So tldr is that salary cap is very important and very complicated. It plays a huge factor in signing guys and building a good team.",3,2022-03-23 13:46:20

You can ALWAYS free up space, the only question is if the team wants to. You could have absolutely signed Adams to a contract where he had a cap hit of 5 million per year for the next 2 years through void years and creative contract structuring, which would allow you to sign the other people you mentioned and keep Adams. You could also keep the money rolling forward until Rodgers retires, which is exactly what the Saints did. 

The cap exists and has restrictions, but if a team wants a group of players they can absolutely make it happen. Especially when you are in the packers situation where you’re going all in for the next couple years. Like you’re seriously arguing it’s impossible to do this when we’ve seen the saints do it for the last like 5 years. How do you think the bucs have been able to sign players like Barrett and Brady to deals close to or above 20 million each when they only had 15 million in space ?

Also, the bucs had to free up space, which is something the packers can do. They just don’t like doing it, but that’s different than saying they can’t. It is absolutely comparable since we’re talking about a team freeing up space and “ignoring” the cap to bring players in.",-1,2022-03-23 12:41:36

Could a team sign 3 WRs to Adams contract and make it work? No, probably not. Could they do it with 1? And then sign more players with much lesser contracts? Absolutely. 

You can look at contracts like Shaq, Brady, or any one else with void years. You can take a player who has an AAV of over 20 million and lower their cap hit to a much more reasonable number under 10 million for the first few years. The saints have been doing it for half a decade. The bucs for 2 years now. The bucs went into last offseason with 15 million total space and ended up signing like 10 players, over half of which were making over 8 million with 2 making almost 20 per year. There’s obviously a limit (although I will say it’s definitely higher than you think), but the packers were not there.

Frankly I think this is best short and long term. We’re in a position to draft good young receivers in the 1st for once, and Rodgers does great when he’s spreading the ball around. 

Adams and Rodgers don’t need each other to be top 5 in their positions, and I think it’s likely they both wanted to prove that. I love Adams, wish we could’ve gotten him a ring, but I can’t say I’m not happy with the trade. The alternative was nothing lol",5,2022-03-23 11:49:54

And Hill is a well rounded enough receiver that if he slows down some, he can still be very productive. But people also exaggerate how much he may slow down.

Hill is very good.  He's been consistently very good for five straight years, which is impressive.  Over that time span, he's one of the top guys due to his consistency.

But going forward, Adams and Jefferson are both obviously better than him.  Kupp was obviously better last season.  Chase sure looks like he'll be better than him.  Evans isn't as big of a name but has put up better numbers over the last three seasons.

Hill is in the next group with Diggs, Lockett, maybe Higgins, maybe Metcalf, maybe Hopkins, maybe some other guys.  His numbers are generally better than those guys, but again, he plays on the Chiefs.  He won't put putting up those numbers with Tua.",2,2022-03-23 12:41:54

> Around 7:15 a.m., Stallworth was headed toward the beach, driving a black 2005 Bentley Continental GT about 50 mph in a 40 mph zone, according to a Miami Beach Police report.[24] Mario Reyes, 59, was on the busy causeway, trying to catch a bus home after finishing his shift.[25] Stallworth claims that he flashed his car's headlights to warn Reyes.[26] Stallworth struck Reyes with his car, killing him.

In a police investigation, Stallworth admitted to drinking the night before the accident. News sources reported that his blood alcohol content was 0.12, over the legal limit of 0.08.[27][28]

On April 1, 2009, Stallworth was charged with DUI manslaughter; he surrendered to police on April 2, 2009, and was released on $200,000 bail.[29] Under a plea deal, he received a sentence of 30 days in the county jail, plus 1,000 hours of community service, two years of community control, and eight years' probation.[30] His Florida state driver's license was permanently suspended.[31] On July 10, 2009, Stallworth was released from county jail after serving 24 days of a 30-day sentence.

The Associated Press reported on June 16, 2009, that Stallworth and the Reyes family reached a financial agreement, avoiding a civil lawsuit. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed.[32]

On August 13, 2009, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Stallworth would be suspended for the 2009 season without pay. Stallworth was reinstated after Super Bowl XLIV.[",12,2022-03-23 10:42:51

It is far more nuanced than that and a restructures are generally used to help teams more than players. When you convert a base salary to a signing bonus it is just taking the money you would get for one season and spread it over two. You still only get the same money if they cut you the next year. 

Guaranteed money on a salary like Mahomes is also irrelevant, because he is going to earn more than his guaranteed money before he gets another pay raise and he isn't getting cut. Additionally, if you bet on yourself it is better to get a 4 year 50 million deal with 25 million guaranteed than a 4 year 35 million contract that is fully guaranteed. If you perform to your level you can earn more money and if they try to ask you to take a pay cut you can force them to xut you and you can mostly sign a deal for more money.

You clearly are based on your later statements. 

>He was acquitted. He still could have been involved, despite the findings.

You are clearly misinformed about the case because you're going along with the public narrative that this is some mystery where we don't know what happened. We do know what happened. Lewis was with a group of people that were attacked by another group of people outside a nightclub. Two people ended up being killed as a result of being stabbed by two of the people Lewis was with. All witnesses involved testified that Lewis was trying to break the fight up. Lewis testified and identified the two people who committed the stabbings. The courts determined (fairly quickly and easily) that this was a clear-cut case of self-defence and the two people who committed the killings were acquitted. Nobody, not the police, the lawyers involved or any of the witnesses actually thought for a second that Ray actually did any killing. He initially lied about being at the club that night and then ended up testifying, so he was charged with obstruction of justice. The lawyers and police involved with the case fully admitted that the only reason they charged Lewis with murder was to get him to testify about who actually did the killings, which is what eventually happened. 

>Most importantly, a verdict does not always sway the court of public opinion. This is sometimes good, and sometimes bad. Plenty of obviously bad people are found not guilty or booked on lesser charges. Our legal system has an undeniable bias toward supporting the wealthy.

If you're going to make massive assumptions like this why don't you go find out more about the case? This isn't some OJ scenario. Nobody got away with murder. It's an unfortunate incident where two people ended up dead but self-defence is a legal right for a reason. Did Ray commit a wrong by lying about his involvement in the fight to try to distance himself from it? Undoubtedly. But that's a far cry from saying he got away with murder because he's rich, especially considering he was directly responsible for resolving the case in the end.",1,2022-03-23 12:27:21

The advantage comes with owners who are willing to spend more, because good teams can stay good for longer since rich owners can spend more on the bird rights to maintain their stars. It doesn’t really allow teams to get better, since everyone technically has the same salary cap, but having prolonged success is EXTREMELY expensive. Not every owner is willing to spend to maintain a team, which is part of the reason why many teams can’t seem to find success.

If they added void years to Rodgers contract and extended Jaire they would have been able to sign Adams (Adams would also need void years me creative structuring). They could probably save like 7 million next year just on jaire.

You guys are definitely doing it differently than the saints and the bucs. Both the saints and bucs had void years on their QBs. There’s a reason Brady’s cap hit was 9 million last season, despite being paid 25 million cash. Brees was similar. Currently Rodgers has a 28 million dollar cap hit, that can be driven significantly down. 

And it would only really hurt after Rodgers retires, and at that point you’re rebuilding anyways. But either way, you’re proving my point. They could sign him and the others, pushing the money forward. They just chose not to.",0,2022-03-23 13:18:08

Veach clearly didn’t want them that bad. Ofc every team wants the best players, the question is if they want them enough to actually do something about it. He traded one, and what did he offer Matthieu? Restructuring and void years actually do change where money is tied up into and changes who they’d be able to sign.

It’s only a silly way to look at it if you start caring about the extremes and not what’s reasonable. Sure they can’t go out and sign the highest paid player at each position, but I didn’t think that needed to be said.

Hines Ward's production dramatically decreased in his final two seasons.

Steve Smith's production dramatically decreased in his final two seasons.

The same is true of Larry Fitzgerald, Roddy White. Wes Welker was essentially useless during his final 2 seasons. Edelman got hurt in his final season and was utterly useless. 

Andre Johnson's final 3 seasons were extremely less production than any others. 

Reggie Wayne's final 2 seasons were dramatically worse than the rest. Marvin Harrison stunk his final 2 seasons. Boldin's final 2 seasons stunk.

If your argument is that Tyreek Hill will be in the league when he's 34-36, I guess I'd agree.

Sammy Watkins watched his career get completely derailed (like many other players) when he suffered a Jones fracture. Julio suffered that twice in the first 3 years of his career. He's since lived on the injury report with nagging, lower body injuries. We'll see if he finds some health and get some healthy seasons in. As of now, he's still productive when he plays. He just doesn't play consistently. We'll see. Hill hasn't missed too much time to this point in his career, but maybe his health will take a nose dive and ruin him.

tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1xtd18,Peanut4michigan,"I said I was talking about truly elite players. Hill being one of the top receivers in the league for 5 straight years puts him in that category.

Tim Brown had 930 yards at age 36. 

TO had 983 yards and 9 TDs in his final season at age 37.

Ward was battling injuries his final 2 seasons and still put up good WR2 numbers at 34.

Smith was on pace for another 1,500 yard season at 36. Then he got hurt. Then he put up 800 yards in 14 games at 37. That's not bad at all lol.

Fitz at 36 was the top receiver on a struggling offense. His final season was him taking the backseat to Nuk and nursing a couple injuries (first time he missed a game in 6 years).

Roddy White had a very good age 33 season then took the backseat to Julio.

I already mentioned Welker and Edelman being injury plagued. Welker still had a strong age 32 season and Edelman had a strong age 33 season. Both of them were significantly less healthy throughout their entire careers than Hill has been. 

Johnson at age 33 was similar to the first 3 years of his career and one other season in the middle. At 34 his production took a major hit as he switched teams and spent half the year catching passes from a 40 year old Matt Hasselbeck. He was done at 35 with yet another new team and no QB.

Wayne at 36 was comparable to his production at 24 and 25. 

Harrison was an all pro at 34 and got significantly hurt at 35. 

Boldin had 800 yards and 4 TDs in 14 games at 35. 

Keyshawn was about the same or less productive at 33 and 34 than most guys I mentioned that you just complained about lol. 

Moss was a homer pick because he was trash after 32.

Mason and Isaac Bruce also belong on the list along with some others. I just didn't list every single HoF or Hall of Very Good receiver (the truly elite WRs throughout history) in my initial list. 

I'm not saying anyone else is going to be Rice and be a 40 year old all pro. I just said the elite players are still productive into their mid 30s. Which every single one of those guys still had a season at or near the top of the league between ages 33 and 36 even if they had a bad year or 2 before retiring (often due to a significant injury which is more significant due to them already being at the tail end of their careers). Hill may completely destroy his leg tomorrow and be fucked, but so could Chase or Jefferson. To this point, Hill has been most healthy like a lot of the guys I listed. There's no reason to think he can't play well until 33 or 34. People exaggerate the drop off at 30 for players all the time. It's not even 30 anymore either. It's 28 (literally their prime) or 25 now for RBs. It gets more ignorant every year.",1,2022-03-24 08:08:37

tkztsx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1vjqlc,wherethetacosat,"Alright, ignore the reality of how few good wide receivers in their 30s there are in NFL. I'm sure it's just a coincidence. If you say reality is dumb then I guess I can't argue against that.

I checked the receiving ranks for players over 30 in 2021 (notice how we aren't even talking ""mid-30s""? Just 30 or older.). There were exactly 3 wide receivers in the top 50 in yards. AJ Green (#36, 848yds), Marvin Jones (#37, 832 yds, Adam Thielen (#50, 726 yds). Whoop dee doo.

Since 2018, there have been exactly 3 top 20 WR finish in yards (out of 80) by a receiver 30 or older. 

1. Antonio Brown at 30 yo in 2018, and he was 11th. 
2. Julio Jones at 30 yo in 2019, and he was 2nd.
3. Julian Edelman at 33 yo in 2019, and he was 18th.
4. None in 2020
5. None in 2021

That's it. A single decent year (18th!) for anyone older than 30 in the last 4 years. Scanning back a decade, I see Fitz, Boldin and Steve Smith as the only guys having decent mid-30s years, but they are the obvious outliers and weren't worth top dollar contracts either. 

The evidence is blaring that it is flat out moronic to give a wide received a top AAV contract going into their 30s. Best case, they give you a good season in their age 30 year.",1,2022-03-23 18:29:08

You said him getting benched for Robinson because he was dropping balls wasn't a big deal because he caught 70% of the the quick slants and out routes he was targeted on. And 6 mil for a guy filling a spot on the depth chart that most teams pay a guy league minimum seems like an overpay. But these are all subjective arguments.

I get that’s it’s a desperation play but to trade the 1.10 for a 28 year old speed guy and then have to turn around and make him the highest paid ever at his position is dumb. Also this draft is loaded with speed guys…. 

You can get Wilson for cheap for a 4+1 and then potentially after or Hill for like 15% of your cap for hopefully 4 years of continued production and then he’s done. You could draft Wilson and sign a PB caliber WR for cheaper than Hill….

There's definitely not been anything to say the coaching is better. McDaniel is an unknown commodity and Saleh won 4 games so there's nothing immediately apparent there although we retained our defensive staff which is huge.

1. Tyreek did not break the kid's arm. That was never what the concerns were about.
2. When the kid went to the doctor for the broken arm, he had bruises all over his body.
3. Both parents admitted to hitting the child and using a belt on him. 
4. When it looked like CPS was going to get involved, they lawyered up and protected each other.
5. It wasn't prosecuted because those cases are sadly extremely hard to win. Since both parents admitted to hitting the child, they could both claim the other one was the cause for the bruising and have enough plausible deniability to get off.
6. It was also going to cost way too much money and national attention for a case that had a likely chance to lose.

No, I'm comparing one abuse victim returning to their abuser to another. There are plenty of similarities between the two imo, enough to draw the comparison. I'm not saying they're identical, but it's clear the pattern of ""assault victim makes conscious, voluntary decision to allow abuser to stay in their life"" exists in both cases.

Hill doesn't deserve more of a pass just because the person he abused happened to be carrying his child imo.

Stat Muse didn’t rank him in too 30

tkw5cx,Tyreek Hill from Chiefs to Dolphins,Tyreek Hill,Chiefs,Dolphins,i1t6hz7,heavenparadox,"For the record, if you actually followed the stories, you'll see he was most likely not guilty of everything. I'm not saying this as a Chiefs homer, either. I was pretty heavily against him when he came to the Chiefs. It wasn't until the ""kid broken arm"" thing happened that I realized the girlfriend in the ""pregnant girlfriend"" scenario is legit fucking crazy. I'm not saying Hill is a great boyfriend or father, but he fought long and hard to get that pregnant shit expunged (which it was), and then the abuse allegations happened, and there was pretty strong evidence to support the fact that the gf is the one that hurt the kid [(supposedly including text messages where she admitted it, but if that's the case I don't know how she didn't get arrested)](https://twitter.com/bepryor/status/1123999544864382976/photo/1).

Obviously, most people who didn't follow the entire proceedings will figure you're lying/coping/making excuses, but the facts moreso support him not being 100% guilty. He could still have done shitty things, just not to the extent of choking a pregnant woman and punching her in the stomach.",4,2022-03-23 09:04:59

Sean Payton was confirmed to have been aware of the scheme, but Williams not only created it and thought it up, but he ran similar bounty systems in basically every single team he'd ever coached up to that point, and this is backed up by several statements from players and coaches who were with those teams at the time. Williams did accuse linebackers coach Joe Vitt of overruling him when he tried to stop the program as soon as the NFL started investigating, but Vitt denied that and the claim was generally not believed.

Owner Tom Benson was reportedly unaware of the system and asked them to shut it down as soon as he learned, an order that was ignored. Is this true? I don't know. There's no proof that it isn't. Were there similar bounty systems in the NFL? Yes, but maybe they weren't as elaborate. The NFL knew and discouraged the practice.

Probably high ones. People still talk about spygate like it was actually some serious violation. Goodell could have made it clear that it was a small procedural violation but chose not to for whatever reason. Still bothers me that the giants have a fourth rounder moved from middle of the round to the end for a similar sort of violation.

fjon3s,DeAndre Hopkins from Texans to Cardinals,DeAndre Hopkins,Texans,Cardinals,fkp3at1,jd39tc97,One of the worst trades I can think of right now. How do the Raiders get a 1st for Cooper and the Texans only get David Johnson and a second? Hopkins clearly is a better receiver than Cooper in production and talent. Hopkins also doesn't have the off the field concerns of an Antonio Brown. Texans could have resigned Carlos Hyde who outperformed Johnson last year or used the 4th they gave up on a RB in the draft. Also Will Fuller is now the top receiver on the Texans. If only the Bills had held kept the momentum and destroyed the Texans in the wildcard.,2,2020-03-16 16:20:33

fjon3s,DeAndre Hopkins from Texans to Cardinals,DeAndre Hopkins,Texans,Cardinals,fkomki6,SmugglersBook,"I want to quickly say that mahomes is amazing and all that but let’s also take into account that he has the perfect offensive situation maybe ever. Seriously their 4th WR would have been WR1 on the eagles last year. Wilson, prime Rodgers, prime brees, prime Brady, prime Manning could all put up similar numbers to mahomes if they had what he has. 

Watson himself if he continues to improve could put up similar numbers but talking about continuing to improve you could theoretically dump in a ton of players like wentz, Murray, etc. so talking “potential” is imo useless. 

All I’m saying is that right now Watson is closer to Wentz than he is to mahomes, that it to say that Watson is great for a YOUNG QB, but Mahomes is currently super young and playing like he’s in his prime years before his prime is supposed to be.

TLDR mahomes is in a league of his own currently with Wilson being close. All the other young QB’s gotta play catch up.",7,2020-03-16 13:23:30
fjon3s,DeAndre Hopkins from Texans to Cardinals,DeAndre Hopkins,Texans,Cardinals,fkon1wg,SmugglersBook,"Yes, the legend of mahomes is boosted by being in the perfect system for offense. At every level it is stacked. With that being said Watson could ascend to that level, but if we’re already talking hypothetical potential then who else are you also putting in that category? Wentz? Dak? Murray? Baker? Lamar? 

That guy said Watson could put up mahomes numbers and right now he can’t. Watson is incredibly gifted where his ceiling is comparable to mahomes but Watson is inconsistent. Look at his games this year to see, one game it’s 400 yards the next it’s 202 and 0TD. One minute he throws a beautiful ball off his back foot 20 yards down field, the play after that he’ll miss a layup of slant pass. 

I like Watson but honestly he’s somehow become overrated and talked about way above what his production is. Also let’s not discount his weapons they WERE great when healthy. If Dhop and Fuller ain’t great then most of the league is currently playing with garbage that has been set on fire.",2,2020-03-16 13:28:38

I just don’t see BOB do anything that a good HC would do, there’s no incredible scheming, the team doesn’t rally around him, and now he’s making horrible trades, getting rid of players to bring in cheaper not-so-spectacular replacements, taking on other teams dog shit contracts, and renting good players who cost draft capital and will need big contracts immediately like Tunsil but yet he doesn’t lock them down long term. 

I think BOB is just an idiot who’s convinced himself that he’s a genius and the owner is happy to let him fuck the team because it’s cheap enough and fans will still come anyways.

nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz4x0t7,IAmSona,"On the five regular season losses that the Titans had, 3 of those Henry was not able to rush for over 100, and one of those he barely crossed it (Steelers) at 103 yards. Alongside the Ravens loss in the playoffs, Henry also had a pretty terrible game at 40 yards. Each of those games, Tannehill was pretty much asked to step up and carry the games on his back and he averaged 179 yards and 1.6 touchdowns to 1 interception. His QBR on those games was a pretty subpar 84.9, not too good but also not terrible. 

In fact, out of those losses the only game that Tannehill played in, he only had one game where he threw for over 300 yards and that was the Titans blowout loss to the Browns. I’m not saying that Tannehill is bad, on the contrary he’s easily a top 10 QB in the league, but at least I think I’m confident in saying that he isn’t anywhere elite when it comes to games in which Henry is held in check and he has to put the team on his back.",3,2021-05-22 23:24:07

He won’t make any massive plays but tbh watching the film there are very few plays he makes where he makes the play. He has very easy passes and he does them perfectly, but it’s not like a deshaun Watson russe Wilson where they make the plays and the offense thrives around them",3,2021-05-22 18:15:56
nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz4be73,PeePee_hole,"It’s because a system qb has inflated stats. Are you telling me that Lamar in that situation would be worse than tanehill? Also it makes it so tanehill has an extremely easy job compared to every other nfl qb. Look at the system he is in. It relies heavily on play action and short passes. I’m not saying it makes him worse than he plays, I’m saying people misinterpret how good he’s actually playing because of it. It’s not a dumb argument it’s just one people use wrong a lot or completely ignore not realizing how insanely important an easy system is to some qbs performance",1,2021-05-22 19:04:25
nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz47t73,PeePee_hole,"I’d agree with a lot of that but Allen being that low is laughable and yeah dak has never gotten 30 tds cause he’s on a run first team and I know tanehill is too but they pass a lot more in the red zone, and Dallas hasn’t had anyone good in the red zone since witten. And people forget last year he was on pace for an mvp season. I think he is hella underrated and I rarely see anyone rate tanehill right, everyone either has him top 5 or out of the top 10. There was a graph of players efficiency and how often they played “out of system” which was like where the play broke down and didn’t go exactly as planned and tanehill Litteraly was the most in system qb, so although he had some of the best efficiency, you gotta look at the context",1,2021-05-22 18:28:07

And yes LTIR is an option but there’s no guarantee that happens (though the league seems content to let players do it regardless of injured status). Roberto Luongo straight up retired and the Canucks were hit with the cap recapture penalty. I do think the most recent CBA allows Nashville to pay out in installments. But then we’d have our own mini-Bobby Bonilla situation where Weber’s $7.8 million cap hit would be on the books through like 2030. Still, that’s probably better than the old situation, where the Preds would get hit for the entire $24.5 million recapture penalty in a single year if Weber retired after the 2024-2025 season.",1,2021-05-23 13:30:02

nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz5xd6a,None,"That “stacked offense” featuring 0 pro-bowlers and 0 all pros? They were “stacked” by name recognition, not actual performance in 2020.

How was the WFT defense? Top three in the league, torched them for the most yards and second most points they gave up all year. Bucs Defense was trash against a 3rd string backup. I can see why you wouldn’t bring that up.

Since when is 26 points and over 300 passing yards “shutting down” anything? That’s not great, especially in the playoffs. They only were able to lock in when it mattered because Brady beat the fuck out of them so badly in the first half he had them playing from behind the whole way, and his interceptions were functional punts. The Packers defense wasn’t trash, it was middle of the pack at worst and finished top 10 in some areas.

First in playoff EPA/play. 30+ in four straight playoff games. Most TD passes in NFL history by a Super Bowl-winning QB. Most TD passes in NFL history by a QB on a new team. 11 playoff touchdowns. Possibly the best statistical first half in Super Bowl history. Super Bowl MVP.

nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz4zazs,IAmSona,"My whole point is that the Titans are a really good team with a historically good running back in Henry. When he is put in place, it’s up to Tannehill to “play heroball” and he can’t, imo Tannehill isn’t the type of quarterback that elevates his teammates which is why he wasn’t able to carry in those losses. 

Deshaun Watson on the other hand still played ridiculously good and wasn’t able to win on most of those statistically impressive games, so clearly he isn’t the issue with the team. What’s your point? If the Texans would’ve had a better team but Deshaun Watson underperformed, then clearly he’s one of the issues with the team but that’s not the case. 

I’m not saying that Tannehill is an issue, though, all I’m stating is that he isn’t as elite as people give him credit for. A difference between a great QB and an elite one is defined by the games that come down to the wire, and Tannehill definitely has not had too many of those games in his career, it’s pretty clear that teams attack the running game when it comes to stopping the Titans offense.",3,2021-05-22 23:59:01

In playoff QBR, Brady Rodgers and Mahomes were virtually identical (Rivers just had one great game). I get if you don’t think he’s the best QB, but he’s in the top 5 going into 2021 no matter how you want to slice it.

nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz4jqpf,gremlin30,"> Lamar does a poor job coming back from behind 

You either haven’t seen the legendary browns game or just want to hate. I understand you’re mad cuz the ravens beat the Titans this year, and that’s ok cuz we were mad at the Titans last year, but this is a bad take. Ravens fans never say Lamar is perfect- he’s got flaws and things to work on. Lamar himself is a very humble dude and would agree he’s got weaknesses. He’s 24 ffs. Has tannehill won any MVPs? Didn’t think so. Has Tannehill led his team on a 14 game winning streak? Hell no. Henry carries that team as much (more, really) than Lamar carries the Ravens. Hating Lamar for beating your team is ok, but at least have legit criticisms. 

Let’s look at Tannehill’s mettle- he’s been in the league for 9 years, and he’s only had 2 seasons where his team was above .500. Henry is great in the 4th quarter too, but that doesn’t mean anything when the Ravens held him to only 40 yards. 

Let’s actually compare passing stats between Lamar & tannehill:

- Lamar has a higher completion % (and that’s with crap receivers)

- Lamar has a higher avg yds/att

- Lamar has the record for most games with a perfect passer rating (tied with Ben)

- Lamar’s led the ravens to the playoffs more times than Tannehill even though Tannehill’s already been in the NFL for a decade

- Lamar has a higher avg pass yds in the postseason

- Lamar led the NFL in pass TDs in 2019

Lamar’s already eclipsed Tannehill in overall talent, and he’s only been in the NFL for 3 years. He’s basically equal to Tannehill in pass ability, and that’s with crap receivers. We haven’t even seen peak Lamar yet. Factor in Lamar’s ridiculous running talent, and he’s overall a better, more well-rounded QB than Tannehill.",3,2021-05-22 20:34:15

Tannehill had fewer sacks: 1.5 S/G vs 1.9 (this could be argued it’s because of playstyle, but  the pressure % for both teams is basically even, so I don’t think this is an apples to oranges comparison)

And in that playoff game last year, Tannehill actually was the better passer: 4.93 ANY/A vs 3.80

nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz4vyrv,DeliciousRoof0,Passing nothing. But better points per game and points per 100 snaps. Lamar is unique. Tannehill is also in a great offense for him. As a ravens fan it’s so stupid to keep engaging in this “Lamar as a passer” argument. He’s 24 yrs old he’s not a great passer yet but he’s a great passing talent. Gotta stop comparing him to regular qbs,5,2021-05-22 23:08:45
nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz4rbvl,None,"Tannehill is a really good quarterback and that’s basically where I leave it. He’s been very consistent and he’s very accurate. But it’s easier to be accurate and consistent when the run game is always a threat too. That being said, every time Henry is held to 100 yards or less and Tannehill is forced to throw more we lose. So that’s my hang up on him. Everyone in our fam base worships him because he’s the best QB we’ve had in awhile. But it’s worth noting that when mariota was benched for Tanny there were tons of other adjustments made as well, and if they were made sooner we probably wouldn’t have ever needed Tannehill. But that is an unpopular opinion within our fam base so till stop there.

He gets down and loses some games like EVERY FUCKING OTHER QB EVER. It’s the nfl it happens. He’s lost so few games and dominated so many it’s easy to focus on his losses. But the sample size is too small. Someone should check the stats but I bet even the Mannings and Bradys of the world don’t win when down more than they lose when down.

nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz4klz3,PeePee_hole,"All good I already tried to respond lmao 

Ok I will admit me saying he adds nothing is not the right wording. He adds stability and a solid passer who is very consistent and that is an amazing thing. What I meant is he doesn’t add anything special. He doesn’t add the insane game iq of Brady, or the rocket arm of Allen or Mahomes. He doesn’t have the crazy legs of Lamar or the shiftiness of Wilson and Watson. He doesn’t have that “it” factor that an elite qb needs. When scheming against the titans a team doesn’t need to change their playstyle to adapt to him. He runs the offense exactly as vrable wants, and doesn’t make mistakes. That’s why the team started 2-4 cause mariota made a lot of mistakes. So when I say he doesn’t add anything I mean more that he doesn’t hurt the offense but he isn’t the type of guy you can build your offense around cause there’s nothing insanely special about him. Like imo his best trait is his consistency, which yes is exactly what is needed in that offense. But when I think of a qbs skill, what I’m imagining is if every qb was put on a team that is completely average but made exactly for them, who would be the best. I can’t see tanehill leading an average team to be top 5 more than I can see Brady(who has many times) Lamar(who has a below average offense and makes it elite) Allen (who is in a similar boat to lamar although he does have an amazing wr, still adds more to the offense) Mahomes, Rodgers, Wilson, and watson (who will be excellent next year. On the prison team where he belongs). I do believe he could lead that team to be top 10, but I value actual skill over production and I don’t think tanehill is a top 5 most skilled qb. I think he is 9th, 8th excluding Watson. And I’m not just talking about raw talent, I’m including mental talent and how refined and all that. Cause tbh production comes just as much from the system and players around the qb as it does from him, skill is really what separates the best from the rest",1,2021-05-22 20:44:05
nio78u,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gz4r47b,PeePee_hole,"I mean everyone looks good in New England behind Brady so that’s not saying much and keenum looked good on the box score but a deeper look at his stats and he really didnt. And I do understand what you’re saying but Allen was an mvp front runner this year. Stafford has shown what he can do and although he’ll take a step up this year, it’s not as much as Allen can do. Allen has way more potential than Stafford and Tanehill and last year showed that he has refined himself. I agree sole qbs do fall off but usually it’s cause their season is clearly a fluke when looking at it, either like Wentz where he only was good on 3rd and 4th or with the qbs you mentioned who still had glaring flaws. This off-season Allen managed to eliminate almost all of those so unless he somehow redevelops them he is top 7. And the difference is he learned and fixed it and you can see it in his mechanics while many of those other guys covered up their issues. I agree about dak though he’s wildly underrated and I have him above Allen",1,2021-05-22 22:03:30

He doesn’t have an insane skill set, but he brings consistency and great passing ability. I also never thought he was too 5 as someone earlier in the thread said, despite his stats supporting that. I’m just glad we were able to clarify enough to go from “he doesn’t add anything to the team” to he’s “a top 10 QB”, especially considering finding a multi-year starter at QB is difficult enough, let alone finding a top 10 one. My only refute is that just because his play doesn’t jump out at you like the other guys you mentioned, doesn’t mean he doesn’t have an “it” factor. Leadership and winning can be an “it” factor. Brady was not known for his crazy game IQ for quite some time early in his career. He was known for winning at all costs. In no way am I comparing the two, just using him as an example.

It was always ""we think it's Jones but a chance of Lance too""

Was it accurate? I have no idea what was and what wasn't

But it wasn't some totally unexpected outcome based purely on pre draft buzz like taking Fields would have been",-1,2021-05-30 11:17:10

What I was trying to say was that it doesn't matter if they liked Lance the entire time, if they liked Mac Jones, if they liked fucking Ian Book at first.

This is ridiculous just because hes getting traded. Julio isnt an unproven commodity he leads NFL HISTORY in yards per game and if you need any indicator on how good he is look at how players from every team in the NFL are trying to recruit him. He is #1 wherever he goes until he shows he cant do it. The only exception atm to me and I know im biased would be Arizona cuz Nuke is that guy now.,-1,2021-05-30 09:21:50

nocsc7,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,gzzl902,MelfromMilwaukie,"I agree and this appears to be news to some. This doesn't apply to most players, but the Eagles would not want to come out of pocket serious draft capital for a HOF vet that said ""I don't want to play there"" (just using Philly as an example).

Hell, even La'el Collins had enough clout to insist that he only wanted to play for the Cowboys during his debacle, and amazingly no one spent even a 7th on him. If memory serves. 

If a player is not already under contract with the team, the team usually won't want him if he openly doesn't want to be there. And they especially are less likely to want to pay draft picks for a player that openly doesn't want to be there. 

If they get traded, players like Julio and Rodgers have say in where they get traded to.",3,2021-05-30 09:30:39

nocsc7,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,h0015s0,FreestyleKneepad,"Y'know what, as far as what the media was suggesting, that's a fair point. Chalk it up to being in the middle of the whirlwind and getting 3 QB names seared into the crevices of my brain for a month.

I can for sure say it was 80-90% coverage about ""The 49ers are taking Mac Jones"" though. And given that the FO came out and said that:

* They didn't try as hard for Stafford as the media suggested
* They didn't try as hard for Deshaun Watson as the media suggested
* They didn't try as hard for Aaron Rodgers as the media suggested
* They didn't try as hard for Joe Flacco as the media suggested
* They didn't try as hard for Mac Jones as the media suggested

I'm way more inclined to believe the Niners FO over basically anyone in sports media right now, at least over Niners matters. 

https://twitter.com/mattbarrows/status/1387834385601220609?s=20

The media grasps at straws and the Niners FO doesn't leak. I'm sure of these two things at this point.

To pull it back to the thread topic, does this mean they're accurate about the Titans going hard after Julio, or that they're accurate that the Titans are the most likely landing zone? I have no idea. But I sure as hell don't trust reports until the new contract is inked. I hope you can see why.",4,2021-05-30 11:43:20
nocsc7,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,h00b547,FreestyleKneepad,"Oh sure, that's fair.

That said, if something like this did become possible, I still think the original team should be responsible for the value. I’m kinda struggling putting into words, but I don’t want to see the cheap ass Bengals owner trade away half his cap so he can have tons of cheap rookies or UDFAs. 

Or like, if you’re trading cap space, you’re also trading some of your market share from the profits of the NFL. If you’re putting less in the pot, you should get a smaller return.

That goes against the very spirt of the cap which means you have to make tough dessisions about who to keep and who to let go of. It could in theory reusher the dynasties of old where they just ran it back every year with no fear of free agency.",26,2021-06-05 07:38:36

* Salary cap trades are only valid after the NFL draft.  Team in bad cap situation is still hindered when competing against good cap space teams when FA starts.
* Making it post-draft means teams will always be able to sign their draft picks (like this year Falcons).
* Team is only allowed to make only 1 or 2 cap-space trades in offseason.  This will also make it harder for teams in bad cap space to escape easily.",2,2021-06-05 08:32:22

If for instance you pay a player a $20 million signing bonus all of that counts towards the cash floor although it all might not hit your cap during the spending period.

Under the current CBA teams have to hit 90% of the cumulative cap in cash spending over a 3,3,4 year period.  2021 starts the new spending cycle so we know the cap in 2021 is 182,500,000, 2022 has a ceiling of 208,200,000 and if we guesstimate a cap of 225,000,000 in 2023 that would mean a cumulative cap of 615,700,000 so teams have to spend at least $554,130,000 in cash over those three years.

The NFL as a whole is also required to hit a 95% cash spending every year.  This year that would mean 182,500,000 X 32 = $5,840,000,000.  So the 32 teams combined cash spending this year needs to be at least $5,548,000,000.  The last numbers I saw from the NFLPA reported around a 98% cash spending by NFL teams in a single year and this year it wouldn't surprise me if it was over 100%",47,2021-06-05 08:50:41

Now imagine a situation where he can play under market value and get others to buy in that way they could trade their cap space to other teams directly for players who would help them win a Superbowl and would also be willing to play under market value. This way you don't need to give up draft picks or players, just cap space that you didn't need to use anyways.

This could be abused pretty easily if players care more about winning than they do money. I think if you had a situation like this then you would need to say teams have to use up 90% of their cap each year before trading any leftover cap space away. (Right now it seems like an average of 89% spent over 4 years, so I just barely raised it and made it for each year to prevent taking players for ""nothing"").

A player has to be paid at least the minimum in game checks after signing bonuses, so you can push that down the road.

A signing bonus prorates the money evenly over each year of the contract up to 5 years - including current year.

So if every player were on a 5 year deal and given a max signing bonus since you only end ol up paying a little over 20% in the current year cap it's more than 4x bit less than 5x.

All that means is that a cap hit is not the same as what a player is paid that year. Like here, Tannehill is getting paid $15 million today (or whenever the transaction occurs this week). However, his cap hit will increase over the next two years increases by that 7.8 million, even though it is already paid.

nv6gbo,Julio Jones from Falcons to Titans,Julio Jones,Falcons,Titans,h11pdpf,Kalanar,"NFL has two types of spending.  Cash spending and cap spending.

You can think of cap spending like monopoly money in the NFL game.  

At it's most basic rule you have to use 1 cap dollar for every $1 dollar you spend on a player however there are ways to delay this.  The most common being a signing bonus.  In that case you can pay a player $20 million in real money but instead of having to use 20 million in cap space you can use 4 million in cap space a year over 5 years.  It still equals that 20 million in cap space it just delays it.
If you cut or trade the player before all 5 years are up however all that cap space you still owe the NFL advances up to be due in the current year.  

This is what the Falcons are seeing with Julio.  They owe the NFL 23,250,000 cap space(7,750,000 X 3 years).  This isn't actual money being paid to Julio it's already been paid to him, the Falcons simply were delaying paying the cap space for it.  Since he was traded the NFL wants all that cap space now.  However another rule the NFL has is if the cut/trade takes place after June 1st you don't have to pay it all back this year it can be spread out over two years.  Which is why the Falcons were waiting to trade him.   In that case the 7,750,000 in cap space they owe the NFL this year stays the same but the final two years(15,500,000) advance to hit their cap next year.  It still totals the 23,250,000 in total cap space they owe the NFL.",5,2021-06-08 09:44:57

(I would still go with my chiefs but that might be hometown bias.) But I would take Mahomes and just about any RB over Tannehill and Henry because Mahomes is mf Mahomes. But Tannehill and Henry are both top 5 at their position IMO whereas the chiefs do not have anything resembling a top 5 rb (due to Khunt punting). So it comes down to how you weight the RB play. If you penalize a weak RB, then TItans have the best foursome.

All that to say - if you're run game is only going to give you 2 or 3 yards at best like some - it's hard to get motivated to block.  If it's going to get you 8 or 9 yards like with DH, it only makes things harder for the defense when they run play action.",9,2021-06-07 11:08:45

Like I said, I love Tannehill and his elite level of play these last 2 seasons is so refreshing after all of the years watching average-at-best QB play from VY, Locker, Mettenberger, and Marcus. But as good as Tannehill has been for us, I’m still taking Brady over him every time.",0,2021-06-07 11:51:37

[You can’t just disregard this as not a threat.](https://youtu.be/YvHrkDMJBUc) The fact that Tannehill can do that means defenses need to account for it or they’re gonna get burned. Rivers wouldn’t get 5 yards on that play, let alone score.

Also I’m sure if you took out Tannehill’s kneel downs his average would be higher too. Not that his average isn’t impressive, Lamar averaged 6.3 yards/carry last season (very different offenses, not really comparable). Ironically Lamar also had 7 TD’s.

Saying they are hyper-focused on their offense is just wrong.

ueb3m7,AJ Brown from Titans to Eagles,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,i6mvzpi,KingTwist0314,"Honestly, the Eagles had a great first day of the draft. Jordan Davis was the best DT in the draft imo and he will be great for Philly, I think he was worth the trade up because I'm sure the Ravens would've picked him if he was there. I do think they could've stayed where they were and pick up Kyle Hamilton but this was a fine move regardless. 


Basically trading their second 1st round pick for AJ Brown was a fantastic move considering Brown is likely better right now than any other WR in this draft will be in the future. Giving up a 1st and then having to pay him 25 million is a steep price to pay but I do think it was worth it because imo Brown is a top 10 WR in the league and should immediately come in and make the Eagles better from the jump. The Eagles are inarguably better now and I'm certainly not excited about seeing Brown twice a year lol.",42,2022-04-28 23:18:20

Simmons won't re-sign with us after a subpar year most likely, who imo is the anchor of our defense.  Tannehill will be gone after this year. and Brown was the only receiver he had any sort of chemistry with.  Then we'll have go rebuild with some rookie QB.

AJ Brown's YPC have gone down every year in the three years he's been in the league, and he only got a little above 60 receptions last year.  He also hasn't played in 16 games two of his three years in the league.  Worthwhile player? Sure. 25m player? Eh.

Fun fact, Burks had more receptions, yards and TDs last year than Brown in fewer games, and was the player you had to focus on with the Razorbacks.  And he still got it done.

You gotta give Howie alot of credit, the Eagles are already so much more talented and dangerous than they were before and it's only the first round.

ueb3m7,AJ Brown from Titans to Eagles,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,i6oze3e,KingTwist0314,"I completely agree and I didn't mean what I said as a slight towards the WRs in this draft at all. My bad if it came off that way but I think several of the WRs this year will end up being at or near the top of the league in some way or another after a couple of years and then I've got several more who I think will be solid players who contribute for a long time but may not exactly be ""stars"".


Garrett Wilson, Drake London, Jameson Williams, Treylon Burks, Chris Olave, Jahan Dotson and George Pickens are all players who I think have All Pro caliber potential and will be playing as well as or better than any other WR in the league at some point over the next few years. At the very least, I think all 7 of those guys will make the Pro Bowl atleast once by the time their careers are over. 


Justyn Ross, Khalil Shakir, John Metchie, Christian Watson, David Bell, Jalen Tolbert, Alec Pierce, Romeo Doubs, Wan'Dale Robinson, Skyy Moore and Jaivon Heiligh are all players I think have Pro Bowl level potential and will be solid players for their respective teams for several years. 


I honestly think there is going to be alot of really good receivers that come out of this draft and we might just look back on this draft and view it as one of the better WR drafts in recent memory.",1,2022-04-29 10:57:12

ueb3m7,AJ Brown from Titans to Eagles,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,i6nt8rd,JackFisherBooks,"True, but a better QB is the overriding factor there. That said, Philly has shown in the past that they know how to surround their QBs with capable talent and a good system. Nick Foles might not have been on the same level as most top tier QBs, but he had a very capable cast of receivers and tight ends around him. And he, along with Wentz before he got hurt, was able to carry that team to the playoffs.

Philly just hasn't had that cast of talent in a while. But AJ Brown will definitely help. I still believe Jalen Hurts can elevate his game enough to compete with teams like Dallas. But I still think they're a few pieces away. 

I'm also not confident Dallas can pick up where they left off. Every time Dallas has a winning season, they follow it up by losing key players and regressing badly. And until I see otherwise, I have no faith in their ability to take the next step.",3,2022-04-29 06:03:32

Idk the goal is to win games and we did that with him as the leader of the team. We argubaly had a worse roster than most of guys listed above. If making the playoffs is so ez why are all these guys sitting at home?

We went from 4-12 to 9-8 and a playoff appearance. This is with a brand new coaching staff and a qb in his first year starting. If hurts wasnt a second round pick everyone would agree this was a good year. 


Wentz 2016 - 16 starts 16td, 14 int, 79.3 rating, 3782 yards, 46 rushes, 150 yards



Hurts 2021 - 15 starts 87.2 rating, 16td, 9 int, 139 rushes, 784yds rushing, 3114 passing


If anything hurts played slightly better than rookie wentz and had a better record. I bring this up because everyone wasnt quick to turn on wentz because of his draft profile. In reality you need to just give young qbs time and surrounded them with actual talent. 

In 2016 we had garbage defense, good line, and no wrs. Wentz and the team looked competent but still struggled. We literally saw the same thing happen this year. Im happy the front office are letting it play out because Hurts has shown flashes and our run game was legitimately historic this year. If he even becomes a competent passer our offense is a real problem for teams similar to the 49ers",4,2022-04-28 22:02:37

ueb3m7,AJ Brown from Titans to Eagles,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,i6nvwmf,moesus81,"That’s fair and Dak is significantly better than Hurts right now (and Wentz obviously, since I mentioned Washington)

The SB team was just magical and everything just fell into place that year. The defense held ATL to 10 and MIN to 7. It’s hard to lose games in that situation, even though they were real close to losing the ATL game. Luckily Foles was able to step up in the SB when Brady was just absolutely shredding us for 500 yards. Ertz was our leading pass catcher that year, the top 2 WR (Algholor and Jeffery) didn’t have huge years. They had 119 catches for 1,557 yards and 17 TD combined. AJ Brown is a significant upgrade over both of those guys. 

Philly’s OL and DL is better than Dallas as well but QB is just too important in this era. Hopefully Hurts can improve with a much better cast around him. 

I like Schultz a lot but who is going to be the #2 WR while Gallup is out? ACL isn’t a huge deal anymore but it might take him a while to play at the same level as well. 

I’m also not too confident in Dallas this year but the NFL is so unpredictable, so we’ll see. If Washington’s D is like it was 2 years ago and Wentz doesn’t completely choke when it matters, they will be a problem as well. NFC East is open for the taking aside from NYG.

Looking into 23/24 and Dak’s $100M cap hit those 2 years is rough.",1,2022-04-29 06:24:24

ueb3m7,AJ Brown from Titans to Eagles,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,i6o7guk,None,"Smith, AJ Brown, and Goedert are the pieces needed to make QB decision making much easier.  The impact adding AJ Brown has should be to immediately make things simpler.  You can't double team all three of them.

No one was good enough last year to be the third piece of an effective slot safety net.  This year is different.  I wouldn't be surprised if Reagor is more comfortable in the slot like Agholor in 2017, but if he isn't then we still have Paschal to try out there.

And if Hurts can't keep up with the NFL with these toys, he will never be the guy.  Assuming quality QB play, this is a division winning offense and dark horse for a solid playoff run.  Anything less, and we use our extra picks next year to cash in on a QB.

ueb3m7,AJ Brown from Titans to Eagles,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,i6nyeu4,JackFisherBooks,"I agree. That Super Bowl run by Philly was truly magical. That team just had everything clicking in all the right ways. That's not something you can repeat. Foles just got hot at the right time. And to date, I've never seen Hurts get hot in the same way. But Hurts has never had someone like AJ Brown to throw to. And if the defense steps up, he might not have to win so many games on his own. I think that's key because, unless you're Tom Brady, you just can't win ball games like that.

I'm also not at all confident that Washington will make it work with Wentz. In fact, I suspect that team will completely collapse halfway through the season and will be in the running for the number one overall pick. Their defense just fell apart last year. Plus, Wentz just can't stay healthy. I saw this happen last year with Fitzpatrick. Washington was hyping him up all offseason, hoping he could win with a dominant defense. Then, the defense regressed and Fitz got hurt in the first quarter of the first game. That doesn't bode well for Wentz. I honestly don't see him starting all 16 games in this season or any season at this point.

The NFC East will be competitive, but I think it'll be between Dallas and Philly. I also think the Giants might take a step forward. I think Daniel Jones is no world-beater, but he hasn't had a lot of weapons to work with, let alone a defense. Maybe this year finally starts to change that.

I really want to see him succeed but since in he’s in Washington it’s just so weird. I dislike Dallas and NYG but Washington is irrelevant to me. I’m completely apathetic toward them. I’m not a big fan of Dotson but that means nothing obviously.  

I think Washington takes a step forward this year and if Wentz isn’t what they think he can be, they can get out for nothing next year. Ultimately though, until Snyder is gone they won’t be a serious threat. 

NYG didn’t pick up Jones’s 5th year option so they clearly don’t believe in him and Saquon can’t stay on the field. I do like both of their picks in the first round though.",1,2022-04-29 07:03:13

ueb3m7,AJ Brown from Titans to Eagles,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,i6nsgmx,None,"Yep, the Packers trade was better than the Titans due to age alone. That's one of the reasons this hurts so much. AJ Brown is still so young. The Titans only got 3 seasons out of him. The Packers got 8 out of Adams. Adams is going to decline, maybe not this season, but soon. AJ's best seasons are almost certainly ahead of him (barring injury).

I'm a St. Louis native and the AJ Brown trade makes me feel like I did when Pujols signed with the Angels. It's fucking gut-wrenching. But it's actually worse than that trade was. It's more like if Pujols had signed with the Angels in 2005 instead of 2011.

ueb3m7,AJ Brown from Titans to Eagles,AJ Brown,Titans,Eagles,i6o9tlm,JackFisherBooks,"Good points. I do believe there is such a thing as being too tough for your own good, so much so that you start to hurt your team. We saw that last year with Big Ben. I really believe Pittsburgh hurt themselves by sticking with him for as long as they did. I admired his toughness too, but those injuries clearly took a toll on him. And it severely affected his play. The problem was that they just didn't have a capable backup. And in a division with Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson, that's just not going to cut it.

And honestly, as skeptical as I am, I would love to see Wentz succeed in Washington. I haven't forgotten how dominant he was for the first part of that 2017 season with the Eagles. He was a legit MVP candidate before he got hurt. And while he's not as old as Big Ben, I do think the amount of injuries he has sustained is just too much. On top of that, just look at what happens to players who go to Washington these days. Both Alex Smith and Ryan Fitzpatrick suffered serious injuries in their first season. For Fitz, it might have been career ending.

There's just something wrong with Washington. Every player that goes there only ever thrives briefly before suffering severe setbacks. It's been that way since Dan Snyder bought the team. And at the rate its going, I won't be surprised if that team eventually moves, since nobody wants to give them a new stadium. They're just too consistently bad and the fanbase has just eroded over the years. I've been to that stadium. It's basically a home game for Philly and Washington at this point.

But, if Wentz can buck that trend, more power to him. That should earn him MVP consideration by default. But history is working against him.

I also believe that the Giants' franchise quarterback isn't on the roster. Jones has shown potential, but he regressed way too much last year and he can no longer stay healthy. I wouldn't be surprised if the Giants took a flyer on a QB in the 2nd or 3rd round tonight. And if they do, I'd be willing to bet money that that QB will be starting games by the end of the season.

It may ultimately come down to injury. One thing that I think people overlooked with Dallas last year was how lucky they got with injuries, until the playoffs. It seems Dallas always has such a top-heavy team, which is why they're often on the brink of salary cap hell. Just a few injuries is all it takes to utterly derail their season. Last year, it didn't happen. This year, I think they're gambling it won't happen again and that could backfire horribly.

The Eagles might not have the same glut of talent as the Cowboys at the moment. But in terms of depth, I think they have the advantage.",1,2022-04-29 08:04:21

I blame his lack of production on coaching and play calling.  Kelen Moore is most to blame.   People forget that he literally only has 4 years coaching experience. He should never have been made the OC.   Garrett was a lame duck coach and he had no one else to pick for OC.  McCarthy should have brought in a more experienced OC.  

Until the play calling gets better, I don't see the combo of Lamb/Gallup and whoever the #3 WR is being as successful.   Cedric may be unaffordable.

But on a more serious note, this gives a ton of flexibility of what to do in the draft now. We could either go BPA with our first pick and go depth with WR later. It also allows us to not have to focus as heavily on a deep threat player like Olave or Williams in favor of a bigger body like London or Wilson.

Saying we didn’t overpay for Dak because we had to pay what we did due to the QB market is absolutely revisionist history.

It’s… confusing why I have to spell it out in such detail for you to understand why it is revisionist history. Next time ask, “hey what did you mean by it being revisionist history?” when you don’t understand something rather than assuming the person you are speaking to is incorrect.

Jerry doesn’t see that as a starter as it risks them being the most popular franchise in the world. So he has to be better with contracts but he can’t stop himself with rewarding their draft picks. They haven’t really traded a player until today since Herschel Walker, so they can’t help themselves their for other players or picks.

tco8og,Amari Cooper from Cowboys to Browns,Amari Cooper,Cowboys,Browns,i0fuwrp,KageStar,"> Saying we didn’t overpay for Dak because we had to pay what we did due to the QB market is absolutely revisionist history. 

He was asking for the market rate the whole time, with a slight discount at first to get paid like Wentz and Goff. The cowboys played hardball and he kept producing while the market rate went up. No shit he had them by the balls they weren't going to get him for 32m 2 years after the cowboys rejected that offer and he still kept playing well. The QB market only goes up. Allen is getting 43M a year and RRodgers just got 50m/yr. Jackson and Baker still haven't gotten their contracts either. 


>It’s… confusing why I have to spell it out in such detail for you to understand why it is revisionist history. Next time ask, “hey what did you mean by it not being revisionist history?” when you don’t understand something rather than assuming the person you are speaking to is incorrect.

You're still incorrect on what revisionist history means lol. Nothing OP said disagrees with you, it's not revisionist. No one claimed the rate they paid Dak was the cheapest they could have got him, nor did anyone claim Dak didn't win the negotiation battle. You're literally arguing against yourself. Everything you said is right, but the argument is about Dak being worth what's he paid right now.

Out of the top 10, the acceptable ones are Davante Adams at $20.1m and Tyreek Hill at $18m. Maaaaybe Keenan Allen at $20m. 

And that’s consistent at any point. Maybe 2 of the top 10 highest paid WRs are worth that percentage of the cap.",-5,2022-03-12 11:25:46

Year 1: gunslinger who willed his way to victory multiple times, even at the cost of some bad plays. Remember he was in the OROY conversation with saquon.

Year 2: The freddie kitchens year. He played bad that year because he had the worst head coach in the league and it wasnt even close. There were reports where OC todd monken would chat with the opposing team and straight up tell them 'we dont know what the game plan is'. Not even brady would succeed in that environment.

Year 3: Great year. Pitsburgh kissed our asses and we were a missed helmet to helmet hit from the conference game.

Year 4: He started the season right where he left off in year 3, passing in big volume with amazing plays, only to injure his shoulder because some WR didnt run his route. It took a couple weeks but baker could handle that and played okay later. Weeks later he reinjures that  shoulder and his ankle, and thats when the shitshow started (the only part of bakers career that most people like to remember).

tco8og,Amari Cooper from Cowboys to Browns,Amari Cooper,Cowboys,Browns,i0fxsfi,None,"1. Dak Prescott is paid 40m/yr  
2. “The QB market” is why Dak Prescott is paid 40m/yr  
3. Thus, the cowboys did not overpay for Dak Prescott because it is the QB market that led to him making 40m/yr.  

This is that person’s argument broken down in, honestly, the simplest way I possibly can.  

Saying the QB market is why Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is revisionist history. The reason Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is because of the cowboys front office not properly handling this situation. I explained where they misstepped and how those missteps resulted in Dak having the organization by the balls. As a result, the cowboys placed themselves in a position where they paid Dak Prescott 40m/yr. The cowboys did not pay Dak Prescott 40m/yr because of the QB market. So, saying that the QB market is why Dak Prescott is paid 40m/yr is revisionist history.  

It is revisionist history because the person making this claim is not giving the actual reason why Dak Prescott was paid 40m/yr. He is revising history and saying that Dak got paid because of the QB market when in reality he got paid because of the cowboys mishandling the entire process.  

If this doesn’t clear it up, I don’t know what will. And, as I’ve already said, don’t tell people they are wrong or that they are misusing terms when you are the one that is confused. Thanks.",0,2022-03-12 17:54:16

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",11,2022-03-12 13:14:11

>2. “The QB market” is why Dak Prescott is paid 40m/yr
>3. Thus, the cowboys did not overpay for Dak Prescott because it is the QB market that led to him making 40m/yr.

That's not their argument. The first person said: ""Dallas overpaid Dak (and Zeke but we're ignoring that part). Now they have to get rid of pieces to afford him""

OP said: ""Dak isn't overpaid that's just the price of a QB now. His contract is not hurting the team.""

That's a value assessment based on right now. It's independent of what he could have been had for in the past which is what you're discussing. He's arguing ""if"" Dak is overpaid you're arguing ""why"" Dak is overpaid.





> Saying the QB market is why Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is revisionist history. The reason Dak Prescott is making 40m/yr is because of the cowboys front office not properly handling this situation. I explained where they misstepped and how those missteps resulted in Dak having the organization by the balls. As a result, the cowboys placed themselves in a position where they paid Dak Prescott 40m/yr. The cowboys did not pay Dak Prescott 40m/yr because of the QB market. So, saying that the QB market is why Dak Prescott is paid 40m/yr is revisionist history.

More than one thing can be a factor, they misplayed the negotiations which drug it out and when they finally made a deal ""market"" value had changed. You're painting the two things as mutually exclusive to make yourself right when it's not mutually exclusive.


>It is revisionist history because the person making this claim is not giving the actual reason why Dak Prescott was paid 40m/yr. He is revising history and saying that Dak got paid because of the QB market when in reality he got paid because of the cowboys mishandling the entire process.

You're adding context and it doesn't contradict what anyone is saying. Neither of you are wrong, he's not revising history. Dak's contract amount is literally a product of the QB market. Dallas' misplayed the QB market and cost themselves money. That doesn't mean he's overpaid if he's producing inline with his contract amount, regardless of if they could have had him for less.



>If this doesn’t clear it up, I don’t know what will. And, as I’ve already said, don’t tell people they are wrong or that they are misusing terms when you are the one that is confused. Thanks.

I'm not confused at all, but whatever bro you do you. Have a good night.

More like scratch tickets, with higher draft picks being worth tickets with a higher chance of winning.

But either way, you're conflating a ""smart"" decision at the time with someone ""losing"" a trade.  You can make a ""smart"" decision - as in, the decision that gave you the best odds at the time - and still lose the trade.
  
What you're talking about happens all the time in poker. You look at your hand, calculate some probabilities and make the smartest move you can under the circumstances, without knowing which cards are on the flop. If you make the smart play given your odds, but the other guy ends up getting lucky draw and you lose, is it your *fault* for making the decision you did? No. But did you *lose* the encounter? Absolutely.

Well, draft picks don't catch passes, so until those picks are turned into actual players they didn't do *shit* to make their team better, while simultaneously losing an *actual* player. So the trade is a total loss for the Packers *until* they're able to turn the picks into players to (hopefully) recoup their loss of an actual player.

A million dollars is a million dollars. If you offer me that amount, I know the amount I've traded for. A million for a sandwich? Sure! With a draft pick, you have no idea what player it will be - you're trading for *risk,* not a set amount or known quantity, so you can't assess whether you got a good deal until you know whether the risk paid off.  
  
For your analogy to be accurate it would have to be:  
  
""I'll give you a *gift card* for your sandwich.""  
  
""Well, how much is on the gift card?""  
  
""I don't know. You're just gonna have to risk it.""  
  
So *now* how do you evaluate that trade? You don't, until you figure out how much is on the gift card.  
 
Sure, you could use historical data on what  might be on the average gift card (or quality of player for the average draft pick as it were) to inform your decision on whether you even want to take the *risk* of making the trade (and this is what *you're* calling ""winning the trade"" - that is, if you determine you have a reasonable chance of success) but you have no idea if you *actually* won the trade - if your gamble paid off - until you see what's on the gift card, or what players you end up with.",1,2022-03-24 15:50:04

But I get what the tweet is saying in context of the Browns. They just tied up a shit ton of money in QB, still owe Baker, and lost OBJ. They need some guy to be a #1 WR who is a top 10 or even 15 guy in the league. Cooper fits that bill reasonably, and by trading for his contract before the WR market blew up, they are in a better spot than they would be just trying to pick up an unrestricted FA WR to be that guy now, if there are any left, or hoping to draft one after losing so many picks. As things played out, they have reason to be happier with the move (before he's played a snap of course) than when it happened because they otherwise have a huge hole on offense with few options.

But the players you’d have to compare Cooper to to determine if he’s overpaid are the other guys making $20M. So Mike Williams, Keenan Allen, DJ Moore, Chris Godwin, Michael Thomas.

Compared to those guys, I think it’s clear Cooper is being fairly compensated according to the WR market. He’s produced similarly or clearly out produced everyone on that list over the last 4 years (hard to judge Thomas since you have 2018/2019 in there but he also has just 400 yards total since then due to injury).

If i had to order that list from worst to best:

* Chris Godwin
* DJ Moore
* Keenan Allen
* Michael Thomas

That's considering the last 4ish years for all of those players. And those bottom 4 are somewhat all in line with each other. Michael Thomas at a cap hit for 13m is insanely good. He goes up to 28m the year after, so thats more in line where he should be.

There are also the Harvard, Chase Stuart, and Fitzgerald-Spielberger charts and they're really all over the place. Then of course the teams are almost certainly working off their own proprietary values.


Looking at the Sam Howell trade for instance, here's the value each of the five main charts place on what the Commanders gained:


Jimmy Johnson: 3-95


Rich Hill: 4-111


Chase Stuart: 5-147


Harvard: 7-218


Fitzgerald-Spielberger: 7-241


Edit: Adding that I've since read your full article and understand your reasoning, but some of the issues you point out in FS for example also equate to JJ and RH.

1bh03gs,Diontae Johnson from Steelers to Panthers,Diontae Johnson,Steelers,Panthers,kvex3xw,joey_sandwich277,"No offense, but why would you average out *those* two charts? Hill and Johnson both used the same method for calculating values: historical trades. The difference is pretty much only the data used. Hill used only players after the rookie wage scale, and Johnson was made before that. So basically all you have really done is create a chart that sits between Johnson and Hill.

IMO a more interesting experiment would be to combine Hill with either OTC (Fitzgerald-Spielberger) and/or Harvard charts. OTC measures value based on average second contract, Harvard measures value based on average career AV. In that sense, you'd be getting an average between what teams have historically traded those picks for (Hill) and what a players' actual return is, which is sorry of the reason these charts exist anyway.",1,2024-03-18 04:52:08

1bh03gs,Diontae Johnson from Steelers to Panthers,Diontae Johnson,Steelers,Panthers,kvc3y4q,practicalist,"First, thank you for reading the article and contributing.  There are arguments for all the charts, but I think you can see why the JJ & RH charts worked best for this exercise.  Also, all the values in the combined chart are the result of the values in the JJ & RH charts. I added nothing to them, thus the combined chart is also their values and not mine.

I think you make an excellent point about the middle rounds being devalued in the two charts I used compared to the other charts.  There could be some tweaking that could be done to the JJ/RH and the combined chart that looks into that underrepresentation.

And while I may agree with your examples of the 76th pick not being worth the 101 & 102 picks, or the 200 pick being worth picks 240 thru 246(the first example I am not so sure couldn't or hasn't happened).

But neither example you cited is nearly as horrendous as the one you omitted that came from the article:

In the FS chart, picks 250 thru 257 are worth the equivalent of the 17th pick.",4,2024-03-17 14:08:30
1bh03gs,Diontae Johnson from Steelers to Panthers,Diontae Johnson,Steelers,Panthers,kvbqy9a,practicalist,"IMO, 3 stand out.

The Fields trade netted below what it could have.  However I do think the decision to trade him was correct as he was a sunk cost.  The Bears couldn't pick up the option or sign him to an extension without seeing him play.

Poles misread the market.  I think he was holding out for at least a 2nd round pick like the Darnold trade(a 6th + future 2nd + future 4th if I remember right).  Then all the QB needy teams acquired bridge QBs for very little draft captital.  Poles was then faced with a priced market that was also now berift of buyers.

I have no proof, but I would not be surprised if we find out a team(s) offered the Bears a 4th round pick for Fields and the Bears turned it down early in the market.  

Carolina also mismanaged Burns and ended up having no leverage in the trade market.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that Carolina lost far more potential draft capital by holding on to Burns for 2023, than the Bears lost by holding onto Fields too long in the FA period.

The Chargers were over a barrel so the return on Allen is disappointing but not really egregious.  However the idea that Allen netted less in return than Sam Howell has to stick in Allen's craw.",4,2024-03-17 12:51:19

Maybe the WR room is good enough as is, but IMO the goal isn't to be just good enough, when you know you  have a limited window of one or two years. 

Besides, their defensive line is a shadow of its former self, especially against the pass but also weaker against the run. Thus far it has been hidden pretty well by the poor OL performances from the Titans and Patriots, as well as Nix's struggle with the elements. When up against the competition they will need to beat to be a real threat, I think this issue will raise its head.

Wilson for comparison did 61 yards/game, 3 touchdowns, 44.0 Receiving Success %, and 56.5 Catch % last season without Rodgers.

Wilson has never proven himself as number 1 receiver on a good team level of talent. His yards/game are down this year (small sample size, easily can change with a single above average game at this point), but his catch % and receiving success % are both up with Rodgers this year, which suggests that Rodgers is targeting him in better situations with better passes than Wilson did. 

I'm not sure if you've watched the Jets this year or not, but Wilson is visibly not doing a good job getting open and is frequently enough running the wrong routes for it to be noticeable when watching the games. He's a number two guy at best at this point in his career.",1,2024-10-02 20:14:25

Want to know why I think Aaron is almost as bad, but in a different way? He actually throws his weight around without facing consequences, unlike most of those guys (except Deshaun, seriously, what the hell?). In his first real year with the Jets, Aaron has:


1. Lied about being able to return from an Achilles injury, just so he could stay in the spotlight.
2. Skipped mandatory minicamp for a trip to Egypt, then called out his coach for saying it was unexcused.
3. Demanded the team sign his buddies (Hackett, Cobb, Boyle), but took no responsibility once they did.
4. Either got his coach fired or, at best, failed to step in and defend him after he threw a pick that lost them a game.
5. Publicly blamed a teammate for running the wrong route when he didn’t even have to make that throw—and could’ve taken a checkdown for a first down.
	

Aaron Rodgers is a terrible leader. It shouldn’t be considered taboo or “hating” to say that. Sure, the guys you listed are worse, but I never claimed Aaron’s the worst leader ever. Can we stop making excuses for his poor leadership and admit that while he’s talented, he’s also a huge prick who causes chemistry issues?

1g49eqc,Davante Adams from Raiders to Jets,Davante Adams,Raiders,Jets,ls2ee03,DilligentBass,"Outside of his whiny demeanour rubbing off on everyone. 

Supposedly he lost a lot of support in the locker room when he was filming his series for Netflix. The team thought he was over dramatic and putting himself over winning games. Him and his family ripping into to Jimmy G was looked at as snake like, as bad as Jimmy was at playing the game he’s always been beloved in the locker room. 

Our coach said all healthy players will play a series in the preseason. Davante came out the next day and said he never plays in the preseason and shouldn’t have to. The day after he had a “hamstring injury” during a walk thru and didn’t play in the preseason game. 

Just a lot of typical WR diva shit that was pissing everyone off but he wasn’t as vocal about it as Diggs and maintained a good image with all his public appearances. Which didn’t help some on our team from thinking he was selfish and two faced.

Also another major thing. He was gone from camp for 2 weeks for the birth of his child. Now I’ll absolutely admit family comes before everything. But we were in the middle of installing a brand new offense and having a QB battle to see who would be leading the team. Having your star WR1 absent for that long in that critical moment was also not looked at as a player being bought in. For reference our backup up safety that just got bumped to the starting role missed exactly 1 day for the birth of his kid and the average around the league is 2 days… not weeks. In a different state in the middle of training camp.

This was also the first year since he’s been here that he wasn’t voted a captain by his teammates and there were rumblings about him not taking that too well.",4,2024-10-15 10:09:27

A) If he remains on the roster next year with NO changes, he will be paid $35M. As per spotrac linked above. 

B) If the Jets don’t want to pay that, they will either have to cut him or he will have to agree to less money. 

So there are 4 scenarios:

1) No changes are made and he is paid $35M

2) He is cut after this season and does not re-sign with the Jets. 

3) He is cut after the season and does re-sign with the Jets. 

4) He simply agrees to a contract with less money for the 2025 season (and possibly beyond).

They've had multiple close games, and having that mind meld connection with Davante could have easily been the difference maker, especially in a game as even as last night's.

It would have been *considerably* more useful a week or two ago, but this will undoubtedly help them for this season, and maybe next season as well if they both stick around. Will it give them the boost they need to squeak by the Chiefs in the playoffs?

1g48ini,Davante Adams from Raiders to Jets,Davante Adams,Raiders,Jets,ls1nw4r,Steel_Penguin_,"This is an example of why the Jets franchise will stay cursed. This is such an illogical move considering the current landscape for them. 

No doubt whatsoever Adams is an elite receiver still. No doubt Rodgers can still win games, though I’d argue he’s not quite as elite as some would still say. 

But the jets are 2-4 currently. 

Davante Adams is 32 years old and comes with a hefty price tag, the remainder of which the Jets volunteered to pay 100%. 

Rodgers already has one foot in the door of the old folks home, and is one embarrassing performance coupled with any semblance of an injury away from hanging it up. 

They just fired their head coach, demoted their OC. 

They traded for an elite pass rusher who they can’t/won’t sign. 

The defense, outside of Sauce, can’t stop anyone. 

With an eye on the future, beyond the salary cap allocation now tied up by Adams, they gave up a 3rd round pick which may become a 2nd. 

This move makes sense if they’re 4-2, maybe. But makes zero sense now.

Rodgers' EPA when targeting Davante is 0.37, compared to the 0.15 when he's targeting any other player. The chemistry these 2 have is off the charts.

1g48ini,Davante Adams from Raiders to Jets,Davante Adams,Raiders,Jets,ls2l0g1,batmansascientician,"That's fine, if Adams wants out, he can leave and there's no hit after the season. That's why the deal makes sense for both teams. 

If he gets 100 yards per game in his 11 games with the Jets he has an outside shot at 2nd team all-pro (I suspect he'll need 1,300+ yards and 8 - 10 TDs for 2nd team all-pro at a minimum) 

If the Jets make AFC Championship game, then the Raiders get a late 2nd round pick.

I'm quite confident it will be a 3rd round pick, but if the Jets have the space for Adams and Reddick to come back, I don't see why this is a bad deal for the Jets at all, and it makes sense for the Raiders.",1,2024-10-15 10:43:59

I'm suspecting that Washington would probably be less likely to extend Adams (because Adam Peters probably believes in his own plan to build the team organically), so maybe WFT's trade package was less competitive.

The Jets, however?  They're desperate AF, and they'll likely back-up the Brinks truck (but will probably restructure Adams' next few years to smooth out the massive cap hits).",1,2024-10-15 10:57:03

The Jets have an excellent RB room and if their OLine can ever match the skill guys they should be a playoff team with that D... but that's what we figured 2 years ago when Aaron went over in the first place

1) Brady was not given the keys to the offense, at least not right away. Arians had his own offense that he wanted Brady to learn, and I think that would have been helpful had Brady gotten injured. The fact that Saleh was a defensive coach meant that Aaron had arguments to bring in his own OC, which he did, much to the team's detriment. Arians was/is miles ahead of Hackett as a play caller and schemer. 

2) the Bucs o-line in 2020 was better in pass protection than the Jets o-line in pass protection now. Part of that is talent for sure (Wirfs, Jensen, Marpet), but another part of it is the aforementioned offensive scheme installed by Arians",16,2024-10-15 09:10:26

Also, Rodgers isn’t going anywhere till after the 2025 season. He’d either have to retire and forfeit a bunch of money, or the Jets would incur a huge dead cap hit to cut him this offseason.

Edit: If I am reading his contract correctly, Rodgers retiring this offseason would mean he forfeits roughly $60m in “real” money.

Adams needs to play with a competent QB for the remainder of the year to try and show he's still a premiere receiver. Playing with a replacement level or below QB is just going to hamper his future prospects and he's at an age where he's a moveable asset. Teams aren't going to make him a lynchpin to their organizational plans so he can make moves like this. 

As long as he produces or at least shows talent, he'll get paid and if his QB play drops off, he'll get traded to a competitive team.",1,2024-10-15 09:10:34

A pretty crazy overpay, in my opinion, when Houston gave up a 2nd for Diggs AND for Buffalo to eat his cap hit this year. Not to mention, Houston got a full offseason and season with Diggs.

Imo, it’s a huge overpay to potentially be giving up a 2nd for 11 (maybe more) games with a 33 year old Adams. Makes me glad we didn’t do it. So many of our fans wanted this, but after seeing compensation, the Raiders got the best of the Jets.

1g48ini,Davante Adams from Raiders to Jets,Davante Adams,Raiders,Jets,ls455jo,GucciGecko,"You think the Raiders would've done well with Rich as head coach? I think it'd be the same as we're seeing right now with Pierce. Both are passionate guys but we've seen Pierce struggle with strategic decisions at key points in the game (see the Chargers game this year and several games last year). I think the league doesn't see him as head coach material either otherwise a team would've given him a shot already.

I also felt both Rich and Pierce looked better than they were because of Covid and injuries down the stretch. For Rich it was mainly Covid taking out key players from the other team and last year in 6 of the 9 games Pierce was head coach we played back up QBs some of whom had never played a regular season minute. I think we had to hire Pierce after what happened with Rich and our best players (Crosby and Adams) came out in support of Pierce.

I think Rich might have been better than Pierce because we had Bradley as DC (and with his HC experience maybe he could've helped him a little) and Mayock drafted well his last year here. He would've had to find a good OC, it wasn't Olson, Gruden was the one calling the offensive plays.

I 100% agree that Carr hasn't been the same since breaking his leg and I felt we should've started a rebuild earlier. We still haven't drafted a QB in the 1st or 2nd since we took Carr. I think that was the plan the past 2 years but there were big runs on QBs early both times.",1,2024-10-15 15:48:32

There are also the Harvard, Chase Stuart, and Fitzgerald-Spielberger charts and they're really all over the place. Then of course the teams are almost certainly working off their own proprietary values.


Looking at the Sam Howell trade for instance, here's the value each of the five main charts place on what the Commanders gained:


Jimmy Johnson: 3-95


Rich Hill: 4-111


Chase Stuart: 5-147


Harvard: 7-218


Fitzgerald-Spielberger: 7-241


Edit: Adding that I've since read your full article and understand your reasoning, but some of the issues you point out in FS for example also equate to JJ and RH.

Hill and Johnson both used the same method for calculating values: historical trades. The difference is pretty much only the data used. Hill used only players after the rookie wage scale, and Johnson was made before that. So basically all you have really done is create a chart that sits between Johnson and Hill.

IMO a more interesting experiment would be to combine Hill with either OTC (Fitzgerald-Spielberger) and/or Harvard charts. OTC measures value based on average second contract, Harvard measures value based on average career AV. In that sense, you'd be getting an average between what teams have historically traded those picks for (Hill) and what a players' actual return is, which is sorry of the reason these charts exist anyway.",1,2024-03-18 04:52:08

1bh03gs,Mac Jones from Patriots to Jaguars,Mac Jones,Patriots,Jaguars,kvc3y4q,practicalist,"First, thank you for reading the article and contributing.  There are arguments for all the charts, but I think you can see why the JJ & RH charts worked best for this exercise.  Also, all the values in the combined chart are the result of the values in the JJ & RH charts. I added nothing to them, thus the combined chart is also their values and not mine.

I think you make an excellent point about the middle rounds being devalued in the two charts I used compared to the other charts.  There could be some tweaking that could be done to the JJ/RH and the combined chart that looks into that underrepresentation.

And while I may agree with your examples of the 76th pick not being worth the 101 & 102 picks, or the 200 pick being worth picks 240 thru 246(the first example I am not so sure couldn't or hasn't happened).

But neither example you cited is nearly as horrendous as the one you omitted that came from the article:

In the FS chart, picks 250 thru 257 are worth the equivalent of the 17th pick.",3,2024-03-17 14:08:30
1bh03gs,Mac Jones from Patriots to Jaguars,Mac Jones,Patriots,Jaguars,kvbqy9a,practicalist,"IMO, 3 stand out.

The Fields trade netted below what it could have.  However I do think the decision to trade him was correct as he was a sunk cost.  The Bears couldn't pick up the option or sign him to an extension without seeing him play.

Poles misread the market.  I think he was holding out for at least a 2nd round pick like the Darnold trade(a 6th + future 2nd + future 4th if I remember right).  Then all the QB needy teams acquired bridge QBs for very little draft captital.  Poles was then faced with a priced market that was also now berift of buyers.

I have no proof, but I would not be surprised if we find out a team(s) offered the Bears a 4th round pick for Fields and the Bears turned it down early in the market.  

Carolina also mismanaged Burns and ended up having no leverage in the trade market.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that Carolina lost far more potential draft capital by holding on to Burns for 2023, than the Bears lost by holding onto Fields too long in the FA period.

The Chargers were over a barrel so the return on Allen is disappointing but not really egregious.  However the idea that Allen netted less in return than Sam Howell has to stick in Allen's craw.",4,2024-03-17 12:51:19

I actually don't think Tee is going anywhere and that is fine with me. We know what we have on him and can tag him this year and next year. 

> More likely, Higgins and a 5th for a high 2nd.

The Bengals 5th this year is worth 12 points. So if you subtract that from the value of a high second say the LA Chargers fifth pick in the second which is worth 162, you get 150. If you add both sixteenth picks together (admittedly owned by different teams at the moment) in the 2nd and 4th you get 146. So your deal is arguably *worse* than what I proposed. 

Of course draft pick value charts are kind of just a guideline. Trades vary. Weird stuff happens that you can't predict. 

> A couple Bengals fans at my work were telling me an hour ago that the Bengals had a deal and were trading Tee Higgins and their #18 pick for Justin Jefferson

Haha now that is pretty wishful thinking. I have heard other parties say the Bengals would seek a high second or late 1st for Tee. Again, that is waaay more expensive than what I proposed. I think at the end of the day this just means Tee stays where he is at. I think the Bengals are happy with that and I am too. That isn't to say I don't feel a little bad for a guy but you get $20 million with the tag this year and more next year so...not that bad.",1,2024-03-13 02:28:16
1bczvzw,Joe Mixon from Bengals to Texans,Joe Mixon,Bengals,Texans,kunhc2a,Accomplished-Cat3996,"What is the most you would trade? 

Remember, the difference between a draft pick and Tee is that Tee has already proven he can play at the highest level, catch a TD pass in the Super Bowl, and is a physical matchup nightmare for teams. He has also carried the team when both Burrow and Chase were hurt. 

I should be a GM. Then again, it probably isn't that hard to negotiate when you have highlights like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZodG-_eugZM).

It also worth mentioning that *where* in the second round matters. The Raiders 2nd and 4th is like Tenessee's 2nd and 6th or Washington's 2nd alone in terms of value. I have heard people say a high 2nd late 1st might be what Tee is valued at, so saying a 2nd and a 4th would not be out of the question.",0,2024-03-13 02:14:19
